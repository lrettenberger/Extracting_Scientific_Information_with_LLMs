A protease from Bacillus sp. CHA410 was immobilized using a one-step MOF-embedded approach, resulting in protease@MOF. The immobilized protease was characterized using TEM, FT-IR, and SEM. The optimal pH activity of protease CHA410 and protease@MOF was obtained at pH 8.0 and 9.0, respectively. Thermostability results showed a 25 and 41 % enhancement in the relative activity of protease@MOF at 60 and 70 °C, respectively, compared to free protease. The Km of the free and immobilized protease@MOF in the presence of casein was 0.685 and 0.033 mg/mL, respectively, and in the presence of fibrin, it was 0.292 and 0.145 mg/mL, respectively. The Fibrinolytic activity/Cascienolicylic activity ratio (F/C ratio) of the free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively. The protective activity of both forms of the enzyme was increased in the presence of some divalent cations, including Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions, while it was diminished by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), proposed as serine-protease. A 10 and 82 % enhancement in protease activity of free and immobilized proteases was achieved in the presence of bound, respectively. Storage stability results showed that the immobilized enzyme retained about 70 % of its original activity at the end of this period, while the free enzyme only showed 22 % of its initial activity. The hydrolysis degree of immobilized protease CHA410 in the hydrolysis of fish protein waste was obtained about 46 % after 2 h of incubation at 50 °C. In comparison, it was gained about 20 % for protease CHA410 at a similar situation. The MOF used was ZIF-8, with a molar ratio of Zn2+/Imidazole of 1:2. The enzyme concentration was 10 mg/mL, and the reaction was carried out at pH 9.0. The reaction was stopped after 2 hours, and the hydrolysis degree was measured using HPLC. The results indicated that the free and immobilized protease could be used in the food industry for the hydrolysis of fish protein waste.

The cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation and the crude enzyme was concentrated using ammonium sulfate. The proteins were precipitated and gathered by centrifugation, and then suspended in Tris-HCl buffer and dialyzed for 8 hours, with the buffer being changed three times. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a NaCl gradient. The active fractions were gathered and assayed for enzymatic activity. The molecular weight of the protease was determined by SDS-Page, and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford technique, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.

The tolerance of immobilized protease@MOF to organic solvents was investigated by incubating both free and immobilized proteases in 2 mL of various organic solvents (50% v/v) for 120 min. The solvents used were: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone. After incubation, the free enzyme and protease@MOF were isolated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min and washed three times with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). The stabilities of the immobilized protease to these organic solvents were compared to the free enzyme.

The MOF used in this study was ZIF-8, synthesized using a one-pot method with a molar ratio of Zn2+/Imidazole of 1:2. The enzyme used is Bacillus sp. CHA410, immobilized in the MOF crystal structure during synthesis, resulting in protease@MOF. The immobilized protease was characterized using TEM, FT-IR, and SEM, and its activity was evaluated using various assays. The optimal pH activity of protease CHA410 and protease@MOF was obtained at pH 8.0 and 9.0, respectively, and the thermostability results showed a 25 and 41 % enhancement in the relative activity of protease@MOF at 60 and 70 °C, respectively, compared to free protease. The Km of the free and immobilized protease@MOF in the presence of casein was 0.685 and 0.033 mg/mL, respectively, and in the presence of fibrin, it was 0.292 and 0.145 mg/mL, respectively. The Fibrinolytic activity/Cascienolicylic activity ratio (F/C ratio) of the free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively. The protective activity of both forms of the enzyme was increased in the presence of some divalent cations, including Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions, while it was diminished by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), proposed as serine-protease. A 10 and 82 % enhancement in protease activity of free and immobilized proteases was achieved in the presence of bound, respectively. Storage stability results showed that the immobilized enzyme retained about 70 % of its original activity at the end of this period, while the free enzyme only showed 22 % of its initial activity. The hydrolysis degree of immobilized protease CHA410 in the hydrolysis of fish protein waste was obtained about 46 % after 2 h of incubation at 50 °C. In comparison, it was gained about 20 % for protease CHA410 at a similar situation. The reaction was stopped after 2 hours, and the hydrolysis degree was measured using HPLC. The results indicated that the free and immobilized protease could be used in the food industry for the hydrolysis of fish protein waste. The materials used in this study include zinc nitrate, 2-methylimidazole, Na2HPO4, NaCl, and KH2PO4 from Merck, and fibrin, casein, Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and albumin. The protease producing bacteria were screened in a culture containing peptone, yeast extract, NH4Cl, and CaCO3 at 37 degC and 150 rpm for two days. The molecular identification of the bacterial isolate was done by isolating genomic DNA using a genomic DNA isolation kit and PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene using specific primers.

Protease inhibitors tested included ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 110-phenanthroline, and iodoacetic acid, each at a concentration of 2 mM. Enzyme activity was measured after pre-incubation with metal ions and protease inhibitors for 2 hours in a phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0). The protease activity in the absence of any metal ions/inhibitors was considered as 100%.

The Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots of free and immobilized fibrinolytic protease CH4410 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin are shown in Figure 3. The F/C ratio of free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively, which was higher than that of other bacterial proteases. The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized protease CH441 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin were also studied and are presented in Table 1. However, no proteolytic activity was observed in the presence of plasma proteins, including g-globulins, hemoglobin, and transferrin. These results may be related to the multipart nature of these substrates, which prevent the hydrolysis of the protein substrates and is favorable for human use as a therapeutic agent. In contrast, Krishnamurthy and Belur (2018) studied the fibrinolytic protease from _Bacillus megacterium_ KSK-07 and found a slight enzyme activity in the presence of some blood proteins such as elastin, mucin, hemoglobin, g-globulins, and collagen.

The molecular identification of the bacterial isolate was done by isolating genomic DNA using a genomic DNA isolation kit and PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene using specific primers. The enzyme is named fibrinolytic protease CHA410 and was produced and purified using a two-step process. First, the enzyme was produced in a culture medium containing peptone, yeast extract, NH4Cl, and CaCO3, complemented with 2% casein, at pH 7.0, for two days at 37 degC and 150 rpm. The cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation and the crude enzyme was concentrated using ammonium sulfate. The proteins were precipitated and gathered by centrifugation, and then suspended in Tris-HCl buffer and dialyzed for 8 hours. The tolerance of immobilized protease@MOF to organic solvents was investigated by incubating both free and immobilized proteases in 2 mL of various organic solvents (50% v/v) for 120 min. The free enzyme and protease@MOF were isolated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min and washed three times with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). Protease inhibitors tested included ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 110-phenanthroline, and iodoacetic acid, each at a concentration of 2 mM. Enzyme activity was measured after pre-incubation with metal ions and protease inhibitors for 2 hours in a phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0). The protease activity in the absence of any metal ions/inhibitors was considered as 100%. The Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots of free and immobilized fibrinolytic protease CH4410 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin are shown in Figure 3. The F/C ratio of free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively, which was higher than that of other bacterial proteases. The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized protease CH441 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin were also studied and are presented in Table 1. However, no proteolytic activity was observed in the presence of plasma proteins (educts), including g-globulins, hemoglobin, transferrin, albumin, and fibrin.
