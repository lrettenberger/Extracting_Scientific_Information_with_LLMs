# Abstract
A protease from Bacillus sp. CHA410 was purified and immobilized using a one-step MOF-embedded approach. The immobilized protease was characterized using TEM, FT-IR, and SEM. The optimal pH activity of protease CHA410 and protease@MOF was obtained at pH 8.0 and 9.0, respectively. Thermostability results showed a 25 and 41 % enhancement in the relative activity of protease@MOF at 60 and 70 °C, respectively, compared to free protease. Km of the free and immobilized protease@MOF in the presence of casein was 0.685 and 0.033 mg/mL, respectively. Also, Km of the free and immobilized protease@MOF in the presence of fibrin was 0.292 and 0.145 mg/mL, respectively. The Fibrinolytic activity/Cascienolicylic activity ratio (F/C ratio) of the free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively. Protective activity of both forms of the enzyme was increased in the presence of some divalent cations, including Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ ions, while it intensely diminished by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), proposed as serine-protease. A 10 and 82 % enhancement in protease activity of free and immobilized proteases was achieved in the presence of bound, respectively. Storage stability results showed that the immobilized enzyme retained about 70 % of its original activity at the end of this period, while the free enzyme only showed 22 % of its initial activity. The hydrolysis degree of immobilized protease CHA410 in the hydrolysis of fish protein waste was obtained about 46 % after 2 h of incubation at 50 °C. In comparison, it was gained about 20 % for protease CHA410 at a similar situation. Finally, results indicated that the free and immobilized protease could be used in the food industry for the hydrolysis of fish protein waste.
## 1 Introduction
Microbial proteases have various applications in industries and academia, including thrombolytic treatment, peptide synthesis, protein hydrolysates production, photography, textile, and bioremediation. Fibrinolytic proteases are commonly used as thrombolytic agents because of their low cost, high biochemical diversity, and ability to dissolve fibrin clots directly. Protein hydrolysates are high-energy complements and hypocalifergenic foods, and their enzymatic production enhances their nutritional properties. Researchers have isolated proteases from various bacterial sources, including _Bacillus_, _Shewennella_, _Yersinia_, _Pseudomonas_, _Alteromonas_, and _Flavobacterium_. _Bacillus_ proteases are the best commercial proteases among all bacterial proteases. However, free enzymes have several drawbacks, such as short catalytic lifespan, inadequate reusability, and low thermal stability. Enzyme immobilization is a method to overcome these disadvantages, and nanomaterials have been suggested as innovative materials for enzyme immobilization due to their large surface to volume ratio. Different nanomaterials, such as magnetic nano-particles, silica, carbon nanotubes, electrospun nanofibers, and polymer beads, have been used for enzyme immobilization.
The metal-organic framework (MOF) is a hybrid porous material composed of metal ions and organic ligands linked by tight bonds. MOFs have shown excellent features such as high surface area, large void volume, huge porosity, mild production environments, and facile tunability of pore size and surface chemistry. The one-pot synthesis of enzyme-embedded MOFs was first reported by Lyu et al. in 2014. In this approach, the enzyme is directly embedded in the MOF crystal structure during its synthesis, resulting in high catalytic efficiency compared to free enzymes. Various enzymes have been immobilized in MOFs, including glucose oxidase, glucoamylase, lipase, and laccase. However, there are only a few reports on protease-embedded MOFs. In this study, a fibrinolytic protease from Bacillus CHA410 isolate was purified, characterized, and embedded in ZIF-8, a type of MOF. The morphology and biochemical properties of the enzyme-embedded MOF were characterized, and its ability to hydrolyze protein fish waste was evaluated.
### Materials
The materials used in this study include zinc nitrate, 2-methylimidazole, Na2HPO4, NaCl, and KH2PO4 from Merck, and fibrin, casein, and albumin from Sigma-Aldrich. Other chemicals were also used, including Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from Scharlau Company. The nanocomposites were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the spectra of the nanocomposites. UV-vis spectrophotometer was used to obtain absorption data.
### Isolation and identification of bacterial protease
The bacterial protease was isolated and identified from soil and water samples of Dimand hot spring in Jiroft, Iran. The protease producing bacteria were screened in a culture containing peptone, yeast extract, NH4Cl, and CaCO3 at 37 degC and 150 rpm for two days. The CH4Al10 isolate with the highest halo was chosen for further studies. The molecular identification of the bacterial isolate was done by isolating genomic DNA using a genomic DNA isolation kit and PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene using specific primers. The obtained gene sequence was compared with other sequences using BLAST and the phylogenetic tree was created using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA X software tool. The morphological and biochemical identification of the isolate was done using Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology.
### Production and purification of fibrinolytic protease CHA410
The fibrinolytic protease CHA410 was produced and purified using a two-step process. First, the enzyme was produced in a culture medium containing peptone, yeast extract, NH4Cl, and CaCO3, complemented with 2% casein, at pH 7.0, for two days at 37 degC and 150 rpm. The cell-free extract was obtained by centrifugation and the crude enzyme was concentrated using ammonium sulfate. The proteins were precipitated and gathered by centrifugation, and then suspended in Tris-HCl buffer and dialyzed for 8 hours, with the buffer being changed three times. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column and eluted with a NaCl gradient. The active fractions were gathered and assayed for enzymatic activity. The molecular weight of the protease was determined by SDS-Page, and the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford technique, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
### Fibrinolytic protease assay
The fibrinolytic protease assay was conducted using protease CHA410, with minor revisions to the previous method [40, 41]. The enzyme activity was measured by mixing 100 μL of enzyme (free or immobilized) with 300 μL Tris/HCl buffer (0.5 M, pH 8.0) containing 100 mM calcium chloride. Then, 100 μL of fibrin (1.0%, w/v) was added and incubated at 50°C for 15 min. The enzyme activity was stopped by adding 500 μL of trichloroacetic acid (10%). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 8 min, the absorbance of the obtained supernatant was measured at 280 nm, and the fibrinolytic activity was calculated. The enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 mg of tyrosine/min. The caseinolytic activity was measured using the same procedure with some modifications, using casein instead of fibrin.
### Synthesis of protease@MOF
The protease@MOF nanocomposite was synthesized by mixing Zn(NO3)2 (1 mM) with protease CHA410 (0.02 mgml-1) and 2-methylimidazole (1 mM) for 60 min. The mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight, then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min and washed with deionized water three times. The pellets were dried in a vacuum dryer and kept at 4 degC. The activity recovery (AR) was calculated as 87.5% and encapsulation yield (EY) was calculated as 75%.
### Biochemical characterization of free and immobilized protease
The enzymatic activity of free and immobilized proteases was examined at diverse pH ranges (4.0-12.0) using sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, Tris/base, and glycine buffers. The temperature activity profiles were studied at 20-90 degC. Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to determine kinetic parameters such as _K_m, _k_cat, and _K_cat/_K_cat for both forms of proteases at different substrate concentrations (0.0-0.6 mM) at 50 degC. The enzyme activities were also considered at different concentrations of fibrin and casein.
### Tolerance to organic solvents
The tolerance of immobilized protease@MOF to organic solvents was investigated by incubating both free and immobilized proteases in 2 mL of various organic solvents (50% v/v) for 120 min. The solvents used were: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and acetone. After incubation, the free enzyme and protease@MOF were isolated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min and washed three times with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). The stabilities of the immobilized protease to these organic solvents were compared to the free enzyme.
### Effect of metal ions and protease inhibitors on enzyme activity
The effect of metal ions and protease inhibitors on the protease activity of both forms of the enzyme was studied under optimal conditions. Metal ions tested included Na+1, K+1, Ca+2, Mg+2, Ba+2, Cu+2, Zn+2, Mn+2, Hg+2, Al+3, and Fe+3, each at a concentration of 2 mM. Protease inhibitors tested included ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 110-phenanthroline, and iodoacetic acid, each at a concentration of 2 mM. Enzyme activity was measured after pre-incubation with metal ions and protease inhibitors for 2 hours in a phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 8.0). The protease activity in the absence of any metal ions/inhibitors was considered as 100%.
### Thermal, storage stability and reusability
The thermal stability of both forms of protease was examined by incubating an equivalent quantity of these enzymes under optimum situations in PBS buffer solution (50 mM, pH 8.0) at 60 and 70 degC. The remaining activity of these enzymes was calculated at various time intervals, while the original activity was deliberated as 100 %. The storage (4 degC) stability of both forms proteases was also considered. The reusability of the immobilized protease was evaluated after repeated cycles. After each cycle, the enzyme nanocomposites were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 8 min and washed three times with PBS buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0). Then, the relative protease activity (%) was considered as the ratio of the residual protease activity to the primary protease activity. The leaching of the protein from these nanocomposites was determined by Eq. (3): Leaching (%) = (protein concentration in supernatants/initial protein concentration) x 100.
### Proteolytic activity with different substrates
The proteolytic activity of free and immobilized fibrinolytic BCI was studied using different substrates (1 % w/v) including fibrin, hemoglobin, casein, transferrin, and albumin. The enzyme activity was measured under optimal conditions, with the enzyme activity in the presence of fibrin considered as 100%. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the release of 1 mg of tyrosine/min at 37 degC. The ratio of fibrinolytic activity to caseinolytic activity (F/C ratio) was also measured.
Preparation of protein hydrolysate of Thumus tonggel waste: The protein hydrolysate of Thumus tonggel waste was prepared by the method of Jemil et al. (2014) [42]. The optimal conditions for the hydrolysis were investigated using different concentrations of the protein isolated. The pH was preserved at the optimal level by adding 4 N NaOH. The enzymes were inactivated by adding HCl solution (0.1 N) after different time intervals (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 12 h). The soluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method [39]. The degree of hydrolysis (DH) was measured as described in [41,44].
Fibrinolytic protease production and purification: The CHA410 isolate showed the highest F/C ratio among the bacterial strains, indicating that it is a potent fibrinolytic producing bacterium. The 16S rDNA gene sequence homology of the CHA410 strain showed 97% homology with Bacillus subellus. The crude extract of CHA410 isolate was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, protein pellet centrifugation, dialysis, and Sepharose chromatography. The purification yield and fold were 18.1% and 28-fold, respectively. The fibrinolytic enzyme had a molecular mass of approximately 33 kDa, similar to other Bacillus proteases. The molecular mass of some fibrinolytic enzymes was reported as 44 kDa, 23.5 kDa, and 42 kDa. It was different from serine proteases from Bacillus sp.D-4, Streptomyces sp., and B. subtilis ICF-1.
### Fibrinolytic CHA410 immobilization and characterization
The fibrinolytic enzyme CHA410 was immobilized on a metal-organic framework (MOF) and its efficiency was studied. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford technique and the immobilization efficiency was found to be about 77%. This means that a low amount of enzyme was immobilized on the MOF. In comparison, Junior and co-workers reported an immobilization efficiency of about 85% for collagenase integrated in ZIF-8 during its biomimetic mineralization. Nadar and Rathod reported an encapsulation yield of about 99% with a relative activity of 118 U/mg for glucomamylase. In a previous study, the authors constructed a CLEA of a protease on functionalized magnetic nanoparticles and achieved a protein loading of 70%.
### Analytical characterization
The analytical characterization of protease@MOF was performed using FTIR, FESEM, TEM, and EDX. The surface morphology was analyzed using SEM and TEM, which showed a homogeneous size distribution and an average size of 65 nm. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of Zn elements in protease@MOF. FTIR spectra showed vibrational peaks in the range of 600-1500 cm-1, which are associated with the bending and stretching of the imidazole ring. Additionally, the 1581 cm-1 peak is related to the stretching of C-N bonds in 2-methyl imidazole. The peaks at 2925 and 3133 cm-1 are attributed to the vibration of C-H bonds of the aliphatic chain and the aromatic ring of 2-methyl imidazole, respectively. These peaks confirmed that the ZIF-8 structure does not change after washing. The free enzyme displayed a peak at 1660 cm-1, representing the CO stretching of amide I bond, while the peak at 3406 cm-1 characterized by the CO stretching manner of NH stretching. These bands confirmed the existence of the enzyme in ZIF-8.
#### Effect of pH and temperature on the fibrinolytic activity
The fibrinolytic activity of free and immobilized protease@MOF was investigated at different pH and temperature values. The optimal pH for the free fibrinolytic CH4410 was 8.0, while the protease@MOF showed maximum activity at pH 9.0, with a 28 and 12% enhancement in activity at pH 6.0 and 10.0, respectively. The optimal temperature for both enzymes was 50 degC. The MOF structure might cause electrostatic interactions that affect the dividing of H+ and OH- in the microenvironment and substance solution, leading to the pH-dependent activity. The different conformational changes and structural rigidification in the MOF structure might also affect the enzymatic activity.
Thermal tolerance of the free and immobilized proteases: The thermal tolerance of the free and immobilized fibrinolytic proteases was examined by incubating them at 60 and 70 degC. The protease@MOF showed better thermal tolerance than the free protease, with a 25 and 41 % enhancement in relative activity at 60 and 70 degC, respectively. In contrast, the purified _B. subtilis_ ICTF-1 proteases showed high stability up to 37 degC but became unstable above 37 degC. The _B. subtilis_ ICTF-1 protease retained 50 and 18 % of its original activity after 1 h incubation at 40 and 50 degC, respectively, but completely deactivated at 60 and 70 degC. The enhanced thermal stability of the protease@MOF may be due to the restriction of conformational movement at different temperatures, which prevents denaturation. The rigid conformation of the protease@MOF may shelter the enzyme from denaturation, preserving its activity.
#### The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized proteases
The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized proteases were studied, and the results showed that the Km values of the immobilized protease@MOF were lower than the free protease in the presence of casein and fibrin. The Km values of protease@MOF were 0.033 mg/mL and 0.145 mg/mL in the presence of casein and fibrin, respectively, which were 20.75 and 2 folds lower than the free enzyme. The Vmax value of protease@MOF was 1.5 fold higher than the free enzyme in the presence of fibrin. The results suggest that the in situ biomineralization procedure exposed the active centers of the enzyme, leading to an improvement in the affinity of the enzyme towards the substrate. Similar results were reported by other studies that immobilized enzymes in MOF structures. The Km values of fibrinolytic enzymes using casein/azocasin as substrate were reported to be in the range of 0.66-1.216 mg/mL. The results are in agreement with the Km of the immobilized seriortepodieta on magnetic nanoparticles.
#### 3.4.4 Protease activity in the presence of protein substrates
The proteolytic activity of both free and immobilized protease CH441 was studied in the presence of different protein substrates (1 % w/v), including transferrin, hemoglobin, albumin, Y-globulin, and casein. The results showed that the free and immobilized proteases had 2.44 and 4.05 folds higher activity than the control toward albumin, respectively. The F/C ratio of free and immobilized proteases was 0.36 and 0.43, respectively, which was higher than that of other bacterial proteases. The kinetic parameters of free and immobilized protease CH441 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin were also studied and are presented in Table 1. The Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots of free and immobilized fibrinolytic protease CH4410 in the presence of different concentrations of casein and fibrin are shown in Figure 3. However, no proteolytic activity was observed in the presence of plasma proteins, including g-globulins, hemoglobin, and transferrin. These results may be related to the multipart nature of these substrates, which prevent the hydrolysis of the protein substrates and is favorable for human use as a therapeutic agent. In contrast, Krishnamurthy and Belur (2018) studied the fibrinolytic protease from _Bacillus megacterium_ KSK-07 and found a slight enzyme activity in the presence of some blood proteins such as elastin, mucin, hemoglobin, g-globulins, and collagen.
#### 3.4.5 Effect of metal ions and chemical compounds on the fibrinolytic activity
The fibrinolytic activity of free and immobilized fibrinolytic proteases was studied in the presence of various metal ions and chemical compounds. The results showed that the activity of both forms of the enzyme decreased in the presence of phenylmethyl-subbonyl fluoride (PMSF) and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), indicating that the enzyme belongs to the serine metalloproteinase family. The enzymatic activity of proteases is influenced by metal ions, which can act as activators or inhibitors. Metal ions play an essential role in the activation and stabilization of enzymes by forming coordinate bonds and stabilizing the catalytic active site. The protease activity of both free and immobilized proteases was increased in the presence of divalent cations such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ ions, while it decreased in the presence of K+ ions. The activity of free and immobilized proteases increased about 30 and 44 % in the presence of Na+, respectively. These results are similar to previous reports, which indicated that these enzymes need divalent metal ions.
#### 3.4.6 Effect of some organic solvents and surfactants on protease activity
The stability and activity of protease CHA410 in various organic solvents and surfactants were investigated. In the presence of Tween 20, Tween 80, and Triton X-100, both free and immobilized enzyme forms showed high stability. The protease stability of free and immobilized enzyme decreased in the presence of DMF and chloroform, but increased in the presence of butanol and DMSO. A 10 and 82% enhancement in protease activity of both forms of enzymes was achieved in the presence of butanol, respectively. The reduction in protease activity of enzyme@MOF was due to the formation of covalent bonds between enzyme molecules.
