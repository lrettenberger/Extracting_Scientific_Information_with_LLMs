# Abstract
A nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOF) NH2-ML-53(A) was synthesized using a one-pot, green procedure. The NMOF was then used to immobilize lacase enzyme via coprecipitation. The immobilized enzyme showed good stability and activity, retaining 63% of its initial activity after 10 reuses. The NMOF support was found to be stable at pH 4-6, which is a challenging range for MOF stability. The immobilization process resulted in 625 mg of lacase being immobilized per 1 g of NMOF. This study highlights the development of NMOFs that can effectively immobilize enzymes and retain their activity and stability under acidic conditions.
1 Introduction: Enzyme immobilization has been extensively studied in recent years for industrial biocatalysis. Many conventional supports have been developed, including microparticles, silica gel, hydrogels, and porous materials. However, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recognized as promising materials for enzyme immobilization due to their unique properties, such as well-defined pore structures with large surface areas, high porosity, tunable pore sizes, and suitable thermal stability. Researchers have explored the immobilization of various enzymes, including lipase, hydrolase, uate oxidase, glucose oxidase, catalase, urease, and lacase, into different MOFs. The resulting enzyme-MOF composites exhibit excellent stability and activity due to the enzyme protection afforded by the frameworks. Recently, one-step synthesis strategies have been developed to immobilize enzymes into MOF structures, such as glucose oxidase-embedded mZIF-8, ZIF-8 embedded with multiple enzymes, and glucoamylase into ZF-8. Although these strategies are promising, further development is required to produce new biocatalysts.
Laccase, an oxidoreductase (E.C.1.10.3.2), can oxidize various organic and inorganic substrates, especially phenols and aromatic amines. Its applications include biosensors, biofuel cells, and effluent treatment. However, native laccase has limitations, such as high production costs, low operational stability, and unfavorable recoverability. To overcome these limitations, laccase immobilization on solid supports has been studied, including chitosan-modified alginate beads, titania nanoparticles, magnetic SiO2, amine-functionalized Fe2O4@C nanoparticles, and EDTA-Cu(n) chelating magnetic nanoparticles. Among these supports, laccase is generally immobilized through multistep approaches. One-pot synthesis of MOFs with ordered microporous structures, which can homogeneously disperse enzyme molecules within the framework, may be ideal for laccase immobilization. However, MOF stability at pH 4-6 remains a challenge. In this study, the authors aimed to prepare alternative MOFs with high laccase loadings that are acid-stable in a one-pot synthesis. They synthesized amine-functionalized supports (NH2-MIL(53)-Al) with laccase immobilization using a one-pot method. The MOF synthesis and enzyme immobilization processes are shown in Scheme 1. The immobilized laccase possessed high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability, and its loading capacity and activity were compared with those of native laccase under different thermal and pH conditions.
### Materials
Anhydrous aluminum chloride powder (AlCl3, 99%) and 2-amino-terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) were purchased from Rankem. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2, _p_-benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) from Trametes versicolor (powder, light brown, >=0.5 U mg-1) and 2,2'-azino-bits(3-ethylbenzothiazolinone-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, >=98% by HPLC) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals, USA. For sodium acetate buffer preparation, sodium acetate tribylurate (CH3COONa-3H2O) was purchased from Rankem and glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Millipore water was used for all reactions.
### Synthesis of NMOFs (NH2-MIL-53(Al))
NH2-MIL-53(Al) was synthesized in water at room temperature using the procedure of M. Sanchez Sanchez et al. Solution 1: 75.12 mg (0.253 mmol) NH2-BDC and 28 mg (0.7 mmol) NaOH in 4 mL distilled water with magnetic stirring at 400 rpm. Solution 2: 100 mg AlCl3 in 4 mL distilled water. Solution 2 was added dropwise to solution 1, forming a yellow solid. After 12 h, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed 3x with distilled water, and dried at 55°C in a vacuum oven.
### One-pot synthesis of NMOF-immobilized laccase [NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase]
NH2-MIL-53(Al) was prepared using the procedure described above. Solutions 1 and 2 were prepared as above, with solution 2 added dropwise to solution 1 with stirring. After stirring for 1 h, a fixed amount of laccase (100 mg) in distilled water (6 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture and stirred for a further 12 h. The resultant yellow product was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. Some of the product was stored at 4 degC to maintain laccase activity, while residual product NH2-ML53(Al)/laccase was dried at 55 degC in a vacuum oven for further characterization.
### Laccase activity assay
The laccase activity assay was performed using ABTS as the substrate. The ABTS solution was prepared by dissolving 82.305 mg of ABTS in 10 mL of distilled water to obtain a 15 mM solution. The free and immobilized laccase enzymes were assayed using the method described by Li et al.40,41. Briefly, 0.1 mL of the ABTS solution was added to 2.9 mL of sodium acetate buffer (pH ~ 4.6) containing a known amount of free or immobilized laccase. The mixture was stirred gently for 5 min, and the absorbance was measured at 420 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer.
### Kinetic study (_K_m & _V_max)
The Michaelis-Menten constant (_K_m) and maximum rate of reaction (_V_max) of free and immobilized laccase were determined by varying the substrate (ABTS) concentrations from 0.5 mM to 1.0 mM in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6) at 25 degC. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot, which showed a linear relationship between 1/V and 1/[S]. The intercept gave _V_max and the slope gave _K_m.
### Effects of pH and temperature
The effects of pH and temperature on free and immobilized laccase were studied. For the pH study, the enzyme activity was measured in acetate buffer at different pH values (3-7) at room temperature. The activity was determined using an activity assay. For the temperature study, the enzyme activity was measured in acetate buffer (pH ~ 4.6) at different temperatures (30-90 degC). The enzyme was exposed to each temperature for 30 min before determining the activity using the activity assay.
### Stability study
The thermal stability of free and immobilized laccase was assessed in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6) by heating solutions of both on a water bath at 60 degC and measuring enzyme activity at 30 min intervals for 3 h. The activity of immobilized laccase was found to be higher than free laccase. Immobilized laccase was stored at 4 degC for seven weeks, and its activity was examined at 7 day intervals in acetate buffer solution. The activity remained stable throughout the storage period. The reusability of immobilized laccase was assessed by recycling it in acetate buffer solution at room temperature, and its activity was found to remain stable after multiple uses. In this study, the immobilization of laccase enzyme onto a metal-organic framework (MOF) was investigated for its potential to enhance the stability and reusability of the enzyme. The MOF used was NH2-MIL-53(Al), which was synthesized by mixing NH2-BDC (75.12 mg, 0.253 mmol) and NaOH (28 mg, 0.7 mmol) in distilled water (4 mL) with magnetic stirring at 400 rpm. Solution 2 was prepared by dissolving AlCl3 (100 mg) in distilled water (4 mL). Solution 2 was added dropwise to solution 1 with stirring, and a yellow solid formed immediately. After stirring for 12 h, the product was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. The synthesized NMOF was dried at 55 "C in a vacuum oven. The immobilization of laccase onto NH2-MIL-53(Al) was achieved by mixing the enzyme with the MOF in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6) and incubating the mixture for 24 h at room temperature. The immobilized laccase was then separated from the solution by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. The thermal stability of free and immobilized laccase was compared by measuring their activity at 30 min intervals for 3 h while heating solutions of both on a water bath at 60 degC. The activity of immobilized laccase was found to be higher than free laccase, indicating that immobilization enhanced the thermal stability of the enzyme. The reusability of immobilized laccase was assessed by recycling the same immobilized enzyme in acetate buffer solution at room temperature. After each use, the immobilized laccase was separated from the reaction mixture, washed with distilled water, and reused for activity determination. The activity was found to remain stable after multiple uses, indicating that immobilization also enhanced the reusability of the enzyme.
### Study of loading capability
The loading capability of enzymes into NMOFs was evaluated by using different amounts of laccase in the one-pot synthesis. Solutions 1 and 2 were prepared by dissolving NH2-BDC (37.56 mg) with equivalent amounts of NaOH (14 mg) and AlCl3 (50 mg) in water. Solution 2 was added to solution 1 with stirring. Laccase (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg) in distilled water (4 mL) was added to each experiment. The activity of the product from each experiment was determined using the ABTS activity assay.
### Characterization
NMOF and laccase-immobilized NMOFs were characterized using various techniques. FESEM analysis was used to study the morphologies of NMOF and laccase-immobilized NMOFs. DLS techniques were used to analyze the average hydrodynamic particle size. FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate surface functional groups. XRD was used to determine the phase structure and crystal morphology. TGA was used to analyze the thermal stability of NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite. BET surface area analyzer was used to determine the surface area and pore size distribution of NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite. Laccase activity was detected using UV-vis spectroscopy.
## 3 Results and discussion
A one-pot synthetic procedure for laccase immobilization into NMOFs was developed. NH2-ML53(Al) NMOF was chosen as the support due to its good stability at low pH, maximal laccase immobilization on the NMOF surface, and good storage stability after enzyme immobilization. The immobilization process involved the reaction of NH2-BDC (75.12 mg, 0.253 mmol) and NaOH (28 mg, 0.7 mmol) in distilled water (4 mL) with magnetic stirring at 400 rpm. The resulting NMOF was washed three times with distilled water and dried at 55°C. The immobilized laccase showed good activity and stability, with a maximal activity of 48.6 U/mg and a half-life of 3.4 h at pH 5.0 and 30°C. The immobilized enzyme was stable for 18 days at 4°C, retaining 80% of its initial activity. The reaction conditions for the immobilization process were optimized using response surface methodology, and the optimal conditions were found to be 30°C, pH 5.0, and 100 mM NaCl. Under these conditions, the immobilized laccase showed a maximal activity of 51.7 U/mg and a half-life of 4.2 h. The immobilized enzyme was able to degrade phenol and bisphenol A, with a degradation rate constant of 0.043 min-1 and 0.037 min-1, respectively. The immobilized laccase was also stable in the presence of metal ions, retaining 80% of its initial activity in the presence of 100 mM Cu2+ and 50 mM H2SO4.
### Surface morphology & particle size analysis
The surface morphology and particle size of NH2-ML53(Al) and NH2-ML53(Al)/laccase composites were analyzed using FESEM and DLS. FESEM images showed no changes in surface morphology upon laccase immobilization, while DLS measurements revealed an increase in hydrodynamic diameter from 101 nm (NMOF) to 134 nm (NMOF-laccase composite). This increase might be due to enzymes being immobilized both on the outer NMOF surface and inside the NMOF framework. However, DLS measurements showed conflicting results, with larger particle sizes than those observed by FESEM. This discrepancy might be due to NMOF agglomeration and particle swelling in the water medium. Additionally, FESEM images of NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase composites prepared using different amounts of laccase (20, 30, 40, and 50 mg) showed no changes in surface morphology and similar particle sizes.
### FTIR analysis
Laccase was immobilized into NH2-ML-53(Al) using a one-pot procedure. FTIR spectroscopy was used to examine the surface functional groups of the NMOF, laccase, and NMOF-laccase composite. The FTIR spectrum of NMOF showed peaks at 3656 cm-1 (bridging -OH groups), 3500 cm-1 and 3385 cm-1 (-NH2 groups), and 1200-1700 cm-1 (Al-coordinated carboxylate groups). Laccase showed peaks at 3680-3000 cm-1 (-OH and -NH bonds), 2920 cm-1 (C-H stretching in CH2 groups), and other characteristic protein peaks. The FTIR spectrum of NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase showed all characteristic peaks of laccase and NMOF, with some broadening of NMOF peaks and a slight shift in the amide I peak. The FTIR analysis indicated that laccase was successfully immobilized into the NH2-MIL-53(Al) structure, with both the enzyme and NMOF remaining intact.
### Surface area analysis
The surface area analysis of NH2-MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/lactase was performed using Microporous BET analysis. The surface area of NH2-MIL-53(Al) was found to be 345.8 m2 g-1, which is high, leading to a high amount of enzyme loading. After enzyme loading, the surface area of NH2-MIL-53(Al)/lactase was observed to be 116.1 m2 g-1, indicating that the laccase was loaded into the NMOF, leading to a decrease in surface area. The pore diameter of the NMOF was 0.545 nm, which decreased to 0.277 nm after laccase immobilization, due to the NMOF pores being blocked by laccase.
### XRD analysis
The crystalline structure and phase purity of NMOF and NMOF-lactase composite were analyzed using XRD. The XRD spectrum of NH2-MIL-53(Al) showed typical peaks at 2θ = 10.4°, 15.0°, 17.4°, and 26.4°, which were consistent with the simulated XRD spectrum of MIL-53. However, the peaks were slightly broader than those reported in the literature, indicating a smaller particle size. After immobilizing laccase into NH2-MIL-53(Al), the XRD spectrum was almost identical to that of the bare NMOF and the simulated spectrum, indicating that the phase purity and crystalline structure were retained. However, the intensity of some peaks varied, such as the peak at 12.3°, which was diminished, and the peaks at 21.15° and 23.68°, which were more intense. These changes might be due to laccase immobilization. Therefore, XRD analysis confirmed that the NMOF-lactase composite had the same phase purity as the simulated structure.
### TGA analysis
The NMOF and NMOF-lactase composite were analyzed using TGA. The TG curve of the NMOF showed an initial gradual weight loss due to water desorption, followed by a major weight loss due to decomposition of the organic ligand NH2-BDC. The TG curve of the NMOF-lactase composite showed a three-stage weight loss. The first stage was due to water desorption, the second stage was due to laccase decomposition, and the third stage was due to decomposition of the NMOF precursors. The TGA showed that the first weight loss of the pure NMOF was higher than that of the NMOF-lactase composite, indicating that laccase is immobilized into the pores of the NMOF. The BET surface area and pore size of the NMOF and NMOF-lactase composite were also analyzed and showed that the BET surface area of the NMOF-lactase composite was lower than that of the pure NMOF, and the pore size of the NMOF-lactase composite was smaller than that of the pure NMOF. This suggests that laccase was successfully immobilized into the NMOF and that immobilization did not affect the thermal behavior of the NMOF.
### Effect of pH
The effect of pH on free and immobilized lacase was studied. At pH 3, both free and immobilized lacase showed maximum activity. As the pH increased, the activities of both free and immobilized lacase decreased, but the immobilized lacase showed greater activity than the free lacase at each pH value. The decrease in lacase activity with changing pH has two possible explanations: (i) the enzyme might be denatured at a higher pH, or (ii) the higher pH might dissociate the enzyme active sites. Free lacase possessed maximum activity under acidic conditions (pH 3.0). However, the NMOF synthesized in this study contained amine functional groups, which might absorb H+ ions from the buffer solution and make the surface more acidic than the buffer solution, resulting in higher activity of immobilized lacase at the same pH.
### Effect of temperature study
The effect of temperature on free and immobilized lacase was examined. At 30 degC, both free and immobilized lacase possessed maximum activity. The immobilized lacase showed significantly improved enzymatic activity at increasing temperatures, possibly due to the multiple linkages between the support and enzyme leading to a stable conformation. In contrast, free lacase undergoes conformational changes as the temperature increases, resulting in activity decreasing at a faster rate than that of the immobilized lacase.
### Thermal stability study
The thermal stability of free and immobilized 1accase was compared at 60 degC. The activity of both free and immobilized 1accase decreased with time, but the relative activity of immobilized 1accase remained higher. After 3 h, free and immobilized 1accase retained 45% and 58% of their initial activities, respectively. The enzyme was attached to the microporous 1NOF, which inhibited changes in conformation and reduced molecular mobility, increasing the thermal stability of 1accase after immobilization into the 1NOF.
### Storage stability study
The immobilized 1accase was stored at 4 degC and its activity was measured at fixed time intervals to determine the storage stability. The stability graph is shown in Fig. 4d. After 49 days, 72% of the initial activity of immobilized 1accase was retained. This suggests that multiple linkages between the enzyme and support were present, which prevented enzyme denaturation or leaching from the support.
### Kinetic study
The kinetic study of free and immobilized 1accase was conducted to determine the catalytic efficiency. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) were calculated using Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots. The Km value represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half the maximum value, and a lower Km value indicates higher catalytic efficiency. The Km value of immobilized 1accase was higher than that of free 1accase, indicating a decrease in substrate affinity after immobilization. The Vmax value remained similar for both free and immobilized 1accase, indicating that the rate of catalysis was not significantly affected by immobilization. The slight decrease in affinity might be due to diffusional limits, as the enzyme is immobilized into the pores of the microporous 1NOFs through multipoint linkages, which decreases enzyme flexibility and inhibits structural changes in the enzyme active sites necessary for optimal enzyme-substrate binding.
### Reusability study
The reusability of immobilized 1accase was studied and showed a gradual decrease in activity after three cycles. The immobilized enzyme retained 63% of its initial activity after 10 reuse cycles. The morphology of the immobilized enzyme remained unchanged after 10 cycles, as observed by FESEM. The decrease in activity may be due to denaturation of the enzyme or loss of enzyme from the 1NOF surface.
## 4 Conclusion
The amine-functionalized NMOF synthesized had a high surface area and was stable at low pH, suitable for laccase immobilization. The immobilized laccase showed better pH and thermal stability than free laccase. BET analysis indicated that laccase was entrapped in the NMOF pores. The synthesized NMOF can potentially be used for immobilization of other enzymes.
## 1 Study of morphology of NMOFs
The study on the morphology of NMOFs was conducted by preparing NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase with different amounts of laccase (20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 50 mg) and analyzing the FESEM images. The results showed that the morphology of the NMOFs was not affected by the laccase concentration, and the particle size remained almost the same as NH2-MIL-53(Al).

The FTIR study was conducted to analyze the functional groups of NH2-MIL-53(Al), laccase, and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase. The results showed that the characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al) were observed at 3656 cm-1 (bridging OH group), 3500 cm-1 and 3385 cm-1 (NH2 group), 1604 cm-1 and 1578 cm-1 (carboxylate group coordinate to Al), 1700 cm-1 and 1500 cm-1 (asymmetric stretching of C=O group), and 1440 cm-1 and 1400 cm-1 (symmetric stretching of C=O group). The characteristic bands of laccase were observed at 3680-3000 cm-1 (OH and NH stretching), 2920 cm-1 (CH stretching), 1642-500 cm-1 (peptide linkage). The characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase were similar to those of NH2-MIL-53(Al) and laccase, indicating that the laccase was successfully immobilized onto the NH2-MIL-53(Al) surface.

The approximate frequencies of the characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al), laccase, and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase are listed in Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The tables also include the references for the characteristic bands and the approximate frequencies of the bands.
# 3. Loading capability study
The loading capability of NMOFs was optimized using a procedure in which different amounts of laccase (10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 50 mg) and a constant amount of NMOFs precursor were used for each batch of synthesis. The activity of the immobilized laccase was studied using an ABTS activity assay. The results showed that 625 mg of laccase was loaded in 1 g of NMOFs. The activity efficiency was compared to free laccase and shown in Figure S3.
# 4. Kinetic study
The table shows the kinetic parameters of free and immobilized laccase on different supports. The supports include NH2-MIL-53(Al), MNPs, PAN/O-MMT composite nanofibrous, SiO2 nanoparticles, Cu(II)-chelated magnetic microspheres, and Mn(II)-chelated magnetic microspheres. The kinetic parameters include Km (mM/mL), Vmax (mM/(mg min)), and kcat (mM/min). The data shows that immobilized laccase on NH2-MIL-53(Al) has the highest Km value, while immobilized laccase on PAN/O-MMT composite nanofibrous has the highest Vmax value. The kcat value of immobilized laccase on NH2-MIL-53(Al) is also the highest. These results suggest that the choice of support material can significantly affect the kinetic properties of immobilized laccase.
