The authors synthesized a nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOF) called NH2-ML-53(A) using a one-pot, green procedure. The NMOF was then used to immobilize laccase enzyme via coprecipitation, resulting in 625 mg of lacase being immobilized per 1 g of NMOF. The immobilized laccase showed good stability and activity, retaining 63% of its initial activity after 10 reuses. The NMOF support was found to be stable at pH 4-6, which is a challenging range for MOF stability. The study highlights the development of NMOFs that can effectively immobilize enzymes and retain their activity and stability under acidic conditions. The MOF synthesis and enzyme immobilization processes are shown in Scheme 1. The immobilized laccase possessed high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability, and its loading capacity and activity were compared with those of native laccase under different thermal and pH conditions. The resulting enzyme-MOF composites exhibited excellent stability and activity due to the enzyme protection afforded by the frameworks.

The authors synthesized a nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOF) called NH2-ML-53(A) via a one-pot, green procedure, using anhydrous aluminum chloride powder (AlCl3, 99%) and 2-amino-terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC). The NMOF was used to immobilize laccase enzyme via coprecipitation, resulting in 625 mg of lacase being immobilized per 1 g of NMOF.

The resulting enzyme-MOF composites exhibited excellent stability and activity due to the enzyme protection afforded by the frameworks.

The laccase enzyme was obtained from Trametes versicolor and had a specific activity of >=0.5 U mg-1. The enzyme solution was prepared in 2,2'-azino-bits(3-ethylbenzothiazolinone-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, >=98% by HPLC) at a concentration of 1 mM. The enzymatic reaction was carried out at 25 degC and pH 4.5, with 1 mM ABTS as the substrate. The reaction was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 420 nm, and the enzyme activity was calculated based on the amount of oxidized ABTS.

The NMOF was synthesized using a molar ratio of 1:1:1 for AlCl3:NH2-BDC:NaOH, with a total volume of 15 mL. The reaction was stirred for 24 hours at 25 degC, and the resulting NMOF was washed with deionized water and dried at 60 degC for 12 hours. The NMOF had a surface area of 1500 m2/g and a pore size of 0.7 nm, as determined by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms.

The immobilization of laccase on the NMOF was achieved by coprecipitation, with a molar ratio of 1:1 for laccase:NMOF. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at 25 degC, and the resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with deionized water. The immobilized laccase was then reused for 10 cycles, with a recovery rate of 80% after each cycle.

The stability of the immobilized laccase was evaluated by measuring its activity at different pH values (4-6) and temperatures (25-50 degC). The results showed that the immobilized laccase retained 63% of its initial activity after 10 reuses, with a slight decrease in activity at pH 6. The NMOF support was found to be stable at pH 4-6, which is a challenging range for MOF stability.

Overall, the study demonstrates the potential of NMOFs for enzyme immobilization and their ability to retain enzyme activity and stability under acidic conditions. The developed NMOF-enzyme composites have promising applications in various biocatalytic processes, such as bioremediation, biofuel cells, and biocatalysis.

Laccase (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg) in distilled water (4 mL) was added to each experiment. The activity of the product from each experiment was determined using the ABTS activity assay. The optimal conditions for the immobilization process were found to be 30°C, pH 5.0, and 100 mM NaCl, with a maximal activity of 51.7 U/mg and a half-life of 4.2 h. The immobilized laccase was able to degrade phenol and bisphenol A, with a degradation rate constant of 0.043 min-1 and 0.037 min-1, respectively.
