The nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOF) NH2-ML-53(Al) was synthesized via a one-pot, green procedure using the metal salt anhydrous aluminum chloride powder (AlCl3, 99%) and the linker salt 2-amino-terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC). The reaction was stirred for 24 hours at 25°C, and the resulting NMOF was washed with deionized water and dried at 60°C for 12 hours, exhibiting a surface area of 1500 m2/g and a pore size of 0.7 nm. The immobilization of laccase enzyme onto the NMOF was achieved by coprecipitation with a molar ratio of 1:1 for laccase:NMOF, followed by stirring for 2 hours at 25°C and centrifugation. The immobilized laccase was reused for 10 cycles, retaining 80% of its initial activity after each cycle, and its stability was evaluated at different pH values (4-6) and temperatures (25-50°C). The NMOF support was found to be stable at pH 4-6, and the laccase enzyme, obtained from Trametes versicolor, had a specific activity of >=0.5 U mg-1. The enzymatic reaction was carried out at 25°C and pH 4.5, using 1 mM ABTS as the substrate, and the reaction was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 420 nm. The resulting NMOF-immobilized laccase [NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase] had a specific activity of >=0.5 U mg-1, and the enzymatic reaction was carried out at 25°C and pH 4.5, using 1 mM ABTS as the substrate. The Michaelis-Menten constant (_K_m) and maximum rate of reaction (_V_max) of free and immobilized laccase were determined by varying the substrate (ABTS) concentrations from 0.5 mM to 1.0 mM in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6) at 25°C. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot, which showed a linear relationship between 1/V and 1/[S]. The NMOF-immobilized laccase [ MOF-Name: NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase] had a specific activity of >=0.5 U mg-1, and the enzymatic reaction was carried out at 25°C and pH 4.5, using 1 mM ABTS as the substrate. The reaction was monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance at 420 nm, and the resulting product was separated by centrifugation. The effects of pH and temperature on free and immobilized laccase were studied. For the pH study, the enzyme activity was measured in acetate buffer at different pH values (3-7) at room temperature. Immobilized laccase was stored at 4°C for seven weeks, and its activity was examined at 7 day intervals in acetate buffer solution. The activity remained stable throughout the storage period. The loading capability of enzymes into NMOFs was evaluated by using different amounts of laccase in the one-pot synthesis. NH2-MIL-53(Al) was synthesized in water at room temperature. Solution 1: 75.12 mg (0.253 mmol) NH2-BDC and 28 mg (0.7 mmol) NaOH in 4 mL distilled water with magnetic stirring at 400 rpm. Solution 2: 100 mg AlCl3 in 4 mL distilled water. Solution 2 was added dropwise to solution 1, forming a yellow solid. After 12 h, the product was separated by centrifugation, washed 3x with distilled water, and dried at 55°C in a vacuum oven. NH2-MIL-53(Al) was prepared using the procedure described above. Solutions 1 and 2 were prepared as above, with solution 2 added dropwise to solution 1 with stirring. After stirring for 1 h, a fixed amount of laccase (100 mg) in distilled water (6 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture and stirred for a further 12 h. The resultant yellow product was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. residual product NH2-ML53(Al)/laccase was dried at 55 degC in a vacuum oven for further characterization. The optimal conditions for the immobilization process were found to be 30°C, pH 5.0, and 100 mM NaCl, with a maximal activity of 51.7 U/mg and a half-life of 4.2 h. The immobilized laccase was able to degrade phenol and bisphenol A, with a degradation rate constant of 0.043 min-1 and 0.037 min-1, respectively. The immobilized laccase was also stable in the presence of metal ions, retaining 80% of its initial activity in the presence of 100 mM Cu2+ and 50 mM H2SO4. The surface area analysis of NH2-MIL-53(Al) and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/lactase was performed using Microporous BET analysis. The surface area of NH2-MIL-53(Al) was found to be 345.8 m2 g-1, which is high, leading to a high amount of enzyme loading. After enzyme loading, the surface area of NH2-MIL-53(Al)/lactase was observed to be 116.1 m2 g-1, indicating that the laccase was loaded into the NMOF, leading to a decrease in surface area. The pore diameter of the NMOF was 0.545 nm, which decreased to 0.277 nm after laccase immobilization, due to the NMOF pores being blocked by laccase.
