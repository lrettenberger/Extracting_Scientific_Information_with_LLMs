### Kinetic study
The kinetic study of free and immobilized 1accase was conducted to determine the catalytic efficiency. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum rate of reaction (Vmax) were calculated using Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots. The Km value represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half the maximum value, and a lower Km value indicates higher catalytic efficiency. The Km value of immobilized 1accase was higher than that of free 1accase, indicating a decrease in substrate affinity after immobilization. The Vmax value remained similar for both free and immobilized 1accase, indicating that the rate of catalysis was not significantly affected by immobilization. The slight decrease in affinity might be due to diffusional limits, as the enzyme is immobilized into the pores of the microporous 1NOFs through multipoint linkages, which decreases enzyme flexibility and inhibits structural changes in the enzyme active sites necessary for optimal enzyme-substrate binding.
### Reusability study
The reusability of immobilized 1accase was studied and showed a gradual decrease in activity after three cycles. The immobilized enzyme retained 63% of its initial activity after 10 reuse cycles. The morphology of the immobilized enzyme remained unchanged after 10 cycles, as observed by FESEM. The decrease in activity may be due to denaturation of the enzyme or loss of enzyme from the 1NOF surface.
## 4 Conclusion
The amine-functionalized NMOF synthesized had a high surface area and was stable at low pH, suitable for laccase immobilization. The immobilized laccase showed better pH and thermal stability than free laccase. BET analysis indicated that laccase was entrapped in the NMOF pores. The synthesized NMOF can potentially be used for immobilization of other enzymes.
## 1 Study of morphology of NMOFs
The study on the morphology of NMOFs was conducted by preparing NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase with different amounts of laccase (20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 50 mg) and analyzing the FESEM images. The results showed that the morphology of the NMOFs was not affected by the laccase concentration, and the particle size remained almost the same as NH2-MIL-53(Al).

The FTIR study was conducted to analyze the functional groups of NH2-MIL-53(Al), laccase, and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase. The results showed that the characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al) were observed at 3656 cm-1 (bridging OH group), 3500 cm-1 and 3385 cm-1 (NH2 group), 1604 cm-1 and 1578 cm-1 (carboxylate group coordinate to Al), 1700 cm-1 and 1500 cm-1 (asymmetric stretching of C=O group), and 1440 cm-1 and 1400 cm-1 (symmetric stretching of C=O group). The characteristic bands of laccase were observed at 3680-3000 cm-1 (OH and NH stretching), 2920 cm-1 (CH stretching), 1642-500 cm-1 (peptide linkage). The characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase were similar to those of NH2-MIL-53(Al) and laccase, indicating that the laccase was successfully immobilized onto the NH2-MIL-53(Al) surface.

The approximate frequencies of the characteristic bands of NH2-MIL-53(Al), laccase, and NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase are listed in Tables S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The tables also include the references for the characteristic bands and the approximate frequencies of the bands.
# 3. Loading capability study
The loading capability of NMOFs was optimized using a procedure in which different amounts of laccase (10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 50 mg) and a constant amount of NMOFs precursor were used for each batch of synthesis. The activity of the immobilized laccase was studied using an ABTS activity assay. The results showed that 625 mg of laccase was loaded in 1 g of NMOFs. The activity efficiency was compared to free laccase and shown in Figure S3.
# 4. Kinetic study
The table shows the kinetic parameters of free and immobilized laccase on different supports. The supports include NH2-MIL-53(Al), MNPs, PAN/O-MMT composite nanofibrous, SiO2 nanoparticles, Cu(II)-chelated magnetic microspheres, and Mn(II)-chelated magnetic microspheres. The kinetic parameters include Km (mM/mL), Vmax (mM/(mg min)), and kcat (mM/min). The data shows that immobilized laccase on NH2-MIL-53(Al) has the highest Km value, while immobilized laccase on PAN/O-MMT composite nanofibrous has the highest Vmax value. The kcat value of immobilized laccase on NH2-MIL-53(Al) is also the highest. These results suggest that the choice of support material can significantly affect the kinetic properties of immobilized laccase.
