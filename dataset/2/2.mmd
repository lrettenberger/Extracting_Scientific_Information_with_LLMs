# Abstract

Enhancing the catalytic activity and stability of enzymes is of great importance in the development of green chemical and cost-effective application, with removal of bisphenol A (BPA) as a prominent example. Engineering immobilization carriers and immobilization methods of enzymes endows great potential to achieve above goal. Until now, these reports have focused on employing the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to increase the stability and reusability of enzymes, an enhancement in its catalytic activity has yet to be addressed. This work introduced a biomimetic mineralization process for facile synthesis of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite under mild condition. By exploiting the activity of laccase@HKUST-1, we demonstrated, for the first time, that the integration of laccase and HKUST-1 containing cofactor \(\text{Ca}^{\text{m}_{2}}\) is one lagaled to 1.5-fold enhancement in the catalytic activity compared with free laccase, which was due to the synergistic enhancement of substrate oxidation, Indeed, the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite could function as active biocatalysts under biologically challenging conditions, such as acidic condition, high temperature, organic solvent, and continuous operation. The oxidation of phenols, such as BPA, with laccase@HKUST-1 reached higher catalytic performance than free laccase, and gave 100% degradation efficiency within 4 h. This study provides a feasible method to improve the activity and stability of laccase, which enable completely remove of BPA from the environment.

## 1 Introduction

Enzymes, as eco-friendly and green biocatalysts, meet the trends of sustainable development and green chemistry as they provide high catalytic efficiency, lower energy requirement, mild reaction condition, and less by-product (Gkaniatsou et al., 2018; Hui et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019a). As a result, enzymes find numerous applications including pollutant removal, biomass degradation, drug synthesis, and chemical sensing (Wang et al., 2019b; Rong et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018a). Despite many excellent properties in enzymes, they are expensive and fragile, hampering their practical application (Sarma et al., 2017). In general, enzyme immobilized on solid supports to enhance their stability and recovery stimulates their developments and applications.

Recently, numerous carriers, such as synthetic polymers (Limadinata et al., 2015), magnetic nanoparticles (Han et al., 2018b), silica materials (Gao et al., 2017), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Wang et al., 2017a; Bilal et al., 2018), have been explored for enzyme immobilization. Among these various immobilization supports, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of porous materials, is the popular one because of its high stability, tunable pore size, large pore volume, high surface area and mild synthesis conditions (Liang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019c). These attractive properties have appeared as crucial parameters using as a successful enzyme catalysis carrier, which can facilitate mass transfer while offer superior chemical and thermal protection. For example, recent reports explore the usage of MOFs for encapsulating horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase (GOx) and cytochrome c (Cyt c) via biomimetic mineralization (Zhu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017b; Sonturk et al., 2015). Notably, the stability and reusability of enzymes encapsulated in MOFs have been enhanced, because of reduced mobility by MOFs and easy recycling via centrifugation. However, to practical applications, immobilized enzymes with enhanced catalytic activity is still a high demand but challenging. Using enzyme active center (metal ions or ligands) as inorganic/organic components constructs the MOFs, which can exhibit enzyme-like activity (Wang et al., 2017a). This strategy offers a promising approach for us to prepare enzyme@MOFs with enhanced catalytic activity.

## 1 Introduction 2

Consumer products, including powder paints, adhesives and food plastic packing materials have been continuous increase in recent decades (Mtibaa et al., 2018). One of this major environmental consequences of these usages is release of a considerable sum of BPA into the environment. Due to toxicity and stable structure of BPA, removing the toxic BPA compounds from the environment in a safe and economic way is an immense need. Laccase, a family of blue multi-copper oxidases, contains three types of copper ions namely, type 1 (T1), type 2 (T2), and double type 3 (T3) copper ions. T1 copper is responsible for the oxidation of substrates, and trapped electron. Subsequently, the abstracted electron is transferred from the T1 copper center to the T2 and T3 copper cluster through a Cu-Cys-His pathway. Then the T2 and T3 copper cluster reduce dioxygen to water molecular (Guan et al., 2018; Shao et al., 2019). Thus, laccase can been applied in decomposition of BPA in a safe way (Billal et al., 2019a). Furthermore, we expect that using copper ions of laccase active center as a structure motif to construct laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite will enable the enhanced activity and stability of laccase, which could degrade the toxic BPA in cost-effective and safe manner.

In this study, we showed that the encapsulation of laccase in Cu-MOF (HKUST-1) layer could be a valuable strategy for an enhancement in the catalytic activity of laccase. Furthermore, the Cu-MOF not only performed as protective layer against high temperatures, continuous operation and long-term storage but also could enhance the accessibility of active site of laccase due to its flower-like structure and a high exposed surface area. These findings highlight the superior performance of MOFs for enzyme encapsulation to enhance its catalytic activity, stability and reusability compared with other conventional polymers or inorganic carriers.

### Materials

Laccase (from _Tranetes versicolar_, powder, 0.5 Umg-1, EC 1.10.3.2) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, 98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylicacid (C9H0Co9, 98%) was obtained from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd. Cupric acetate monohydrate (CuCH3COO)2H2O2,0 > 98%) was from Sinopham (Shanghai, China) Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Bisphenol A (BPA: (CH3)2C(C6H4OH)2, 99%) was purchased from Aladdin. All other chemicals (analytical grade) were from Sinopham (Shanghai, China) Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. and used without modification.

### Effect of metal ions and different metal organic frameworks on laccase activity

The effect of metal ions and different metal organic frameworks on laccase activity were detected by several controlled experiments. The method was following, 50 uL of free laccase solution and 300 uL of NaAc-HAc buffer solution (pH 4) were added to the two control experiments. Then 100 uL deionized water and 100 uL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1 M) were added to the two groups of control experiments, respectively. Finally the ABTS was added to measure its activity at 40 degC (Billal et al., 2019b; Asgher et al., 2017a). In order to investigate the effect of different metal ions on the laccase activity, the activity of free laccase was determined by exposing it to several metal ion solutions such as Cu2+, Zn2+, Li+, Mg2+, K+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni+ and Fe2+ (6.25 mM) for 0.5 h at 30 degC. To evaluate which metal-organic framework was beneficial to laccase, two common metal-organic frameworks like HKUST-1 and Zn-MOF were used to immobilize laccase. Subsequently, measuring their activity.

### Enzyme loading

The encapsulation yield of laccase in the HKUST-1 was measured by Pierce=BCA protein assay. The encapsulation yield was defined as the ratio of laccase amount in the laccase@HKUST-1 to the initial amount of laccase. Encapsulation yield was calculated according to the following equation:

\[\text{Encapsulationyield}(\%) = \frac{\text{m} - \text{C}_{1}\text{V}_{1}}{\text{m}} \times 100\%\]

Where, m (mg) is the mass of laccase initially added to the solution; C1 (mg/mL) is the laccase concentration of supernatant; V1 (mL) is the volume of supernatant, respectively.

### Effects of pH and temperature

The effects of pH and temperature on free and immobilized laccase were assessed by measuring the activity in different pH values (pH 3-6.5) and different temperatures (30-70 degC). The method for detecting activity was mentioned above. Taking the optimum activity of laccase@HKUST-1 as 100%. By testing the encapsulation yield, the laccase content in free and immobilized laccase was consistent, and the concentration of laccase in free and immobilized laccase solution was 0.1 mg/ml. In the following experiments, the concentration of laccase was the same as above.

### Thermal stability and pH stability

Thermal stability of laccase and laccase@HKUST- were examined by measuring the residual activity, which were incubated for 1 h at 30-70 degC. The thermal denaturation kinetics of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were expressed by a first-order exponential equation. The thermal denaturation constants (k4) can be calculated according to the Eq. (1). Formula (2) was used to calculate the half-life (t1/2) of laccase thermal denaturation. The activation energy (Ed) of laccase thermal denaturation was calculated by the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)). The enthalpy (AH, kJ-mol-1) for laccase thermal denaturation was calculated according to formula (4).

\[\text{a} = \text{a}_{0}\exp( - \text{k}_{d})\]

\[\text{t}_{1/2} = \text{ln}\ 2/\text{k}_{d}\]

\[\text{ln}\ k_{d} = - \text{E}_{d}/\text{RT} + \text{ln}\ A\]

\[\Delta\text{H} = \text{E}_{d} - \text{RT}\]

Here, a0 is the activity of laccase before incubation, a is the residual activity of laccase after incubation, and t (h) is the incubation time. R is a constant 8.3145 J mol-1 K, and T (K) is the absolute temperature.

The pH stability of free and immobilized laccase were examined by incubating free and immobilized laccase in NaAc-HAc solution with different pH values (pH 4-7) for 1 h respectively. Finally, the activity was determined under the optimal conditions. Taking the optimum activity of laccase@HKUST-1 as 100%.

### Calculation of the kinetic parameters

The values of the kinetic values were acquired by non-linear curve fitting of the plot of the reaction rate versus substrate concentrations.

\[\frac{1}{\text{V}_{0}} = \frac{\text{K}_{\text{m}}}{\text{V}_{\text{m}}} \times \frac{1}{\text{[S]}} + \frac{1}{\text{V}_{\text{m}}}\]

Where, V0 is the initial catalytic rate. Vm is the maximum rate conversion. [S] is the initial substrate concentration, and Km is the Michealis-Menten constant.

### Data analysis

All data in our experiments were derived from three parallel experiments and the average and standard deviation of the replicates were calculated. Student's _t_-test was used to compared whether the difference was significant; \(p\) <= 0.05 was adopted as a criterion of significance. The date were analyzed by Microsoft Excel 2010 and Origin

#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite

According to the catalytic mechanism of laccase (Fig. 1), we can see that the catalytic activity of laccase is determined by active center coppers (Granja-Travez et al., 2018). To further demonstrate the effectiveness of HKUST-1 (using laccase active center as a structure motif of MOF) in enhancing the catalytic activity of laccase, laccase activity assay was performed in EDTA solution, solution of various metal ion and different MOFs. As a first step, the free laccase was incubated with EDTA solution. As depicted in Fig. 2a, no dramatically loss in laccase activity occurred when EDTA was added, because the catalytic copper was buried into the active center and more difficult to coordinate with EDTA. Hence, laccase could be not inactivated by the biomineralization, which was due to that organic ligands of MOFs hardly binded catalytic copper and broke down the electron transfer system. Meanwhile, effect of metal ions on catalytic activity of laccase was also evaluated by incubating laccase with the solution of different metal ions. Clearly, only Cu2+ ion yielded profoundly positive effect on catalytic activity of laccase with 156 +- 1.3% original activities, as presented in Fig. 2b. Such result was consistent with previously reported results (Sun et al., 2019). An enhancement in catalytic activity observed in incubating laccase with copper ions might be the synergistic effect between laccase and copper ions. On the one hand, copper was the active center of laccase, and the introduction of copper ions had an activation effect on laccase activity. On the other hand, the addition of copper ions accelerated the transfer of electrons between the laccase active centers T1, T2 and T3Cu, thereby increasing the activity. Based on the above results, Cu-MOF (HKUST-1) was adopted as protective layer to construct the laccase(r)HKUST-1 through biomimetic mineralization. We speculated that synthetic mechanism of laccase(r)HKUST-1 was that amide groups in the laccase surface coordinated with metal ion, and then act as specific nucleation points to start the biomineralization of MOFs (Scheme 1). As displayed in Fig. 2c, 150 +- 1.3% enhancement of catalytic activity in laccase(r)HKUST-1 had been achieved compared with the laccase(r)Zn-MOF (Zn+ ion had a negligible effect on the catalytic activity of laccase). Here, this work highlighted a valuable strategy to enhance the laccase activity by building a bridge of cooperation between laccase and HKUST-1, using the MOF containing cofactor Cu2+ as carriers for laccase encapsulation.

#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite 2

The concentrations of cofactor Cu2+ ions and organic ligands 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylacied (BTC), concentrations of laccase, incubation pH and incubation time were major factors to influence the formation of HKUST-1 shell, which provided the protection of laccase. Therefore, we evaluated the activity and encapsulation yield of laccase during the biomimetic mineralization process of laccase(r)HKUST-1 in detail to obtain optimum experimental condition. The concentrations of cofactor Cu2+ ions and organic ligands BTC had a crucial effect on both activity and encapsulation yield of laccase, as presented in Table S1 and S2. The relative activity and encapsulation yield (defined in the supporting) of laccase kept increasing until 150.1 +- 2.1% and 54 +- 1.1%, respectively, with the enhancement in the concentrations of Cu2+ ions up to 87.5 mM and organic ligands BTC up to 25 mM. The continuous increases in the concentrations of Cu2+ ions and BTC ligands resulted in a significant reduction in both activity and encapsulation yield of laccase. From further morphology study of the resulting laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite (Fig. 6), we speculated that microparticles with relatively smooth surfaces led to the smaller chance for the interaction of laccase to the substrate and reduction in activity at high concentrations of Ca2+ ions and BTC ligands. Accordingly, high concentrations of Cu2+ ions and BTC ligands also generated rapid coordination reaction between Cu2+ and BTC, while amine groups in the laccase backbone could not effectively bind with Cu2+ ions, resulting in the reduction of encapsulation yield. In order to achieve high activity and encapsulation yield of laccase, 87.5 mM of Cu2+ ions and 25 mM of BTC ligands were selected as the optimum concentrations for further evaluation.

#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite 2

layer was well formed when using acetate buffer solution at the pH 6.5. The result of encapsulation yield of laccase was in accordance with the activity of laccase, which afforded the highest encapsulation yield of laccase, 51.2 +- 1.3%.

The laccase concentration was also another crucial factor for determining the number of nucleation sites, which consequently mediate the formation of HKUST-1 protective layer. As presented in Fig. 3b, we found that 2 mg/mL of laccase was optimal to achieve 153.1 +- 1.6% activity and 56.1 +- 1.4% (147.5 +- 2.1 mgg-1) encapsulation yield. While activity and encapsulation yield began to drop down when adding more than 2 mg/mL of laccase. From results, 2 mg/mL of laccase was determined to properly form the laccase@HKUST-1.

Incubation time played an important role in the activity and encapsulation yield of laccase. Fig. 3c showed incubation time of 8 h appeared to be more effective for encapsulating laccase compared to the lower and higher incubation time of 8 h, giving 153 +- 2.1% and 53.4 +- 1.8% activity and encapsulation yield, respectively. Considering the activity and encapsulation yield, 8 h was chosen as an appropriate incubation time for laccase encapsulation.

### Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite

Successful encapsulation of laccase by HKUST-1 shell was ascertained by FT-IR spectrum. Firstly, the biomineralized laccase@HKUST-1 was washed with water to ensure the removal of surface bound laccase, and then characterized by FT-IR spectrum. As displayed in Fig. 4a, The FT-IR of laccase@HKUST-1 was similar to HKUST-1, with the exception of the peaks at 1657.43 cm-1 belong to C=0 stretching vibration due to the presence of laccase. Other characteristic peaks of laccase were also present in the FT-IR spectrum. For example, the peaks appeared at 1029.93 and 1544.56 cm-1, ascribing to a band of enzyme and combination between N-H bending vibration and C-N stretching vibration of the amide bond. As expected, the above peaks were still emerged in the FT-IR spectrum of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite. The results were consistent with A. Samui et al. (Samui and Sahu, 2018), signifying the successful fabrication of laccase@HKUST-1. Subsequently, we studied the laccase@HKUST-1 by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The presence of N element provided the evidence that the laccase had been encapsulated in HKUST-1.

The quantity of laccase within laccase@HKUST-1 was determined to examine by TGA curves. For laccase@HKUST-1, The TGA curve showed two obvious weight loss steps (Fig. 4b). The first weight loss below 125 degC was probably as a result of the evaporation of adsorbed and bound water. A deeper weight drop from 125 to 320 degC might be attributed to decomposition of laccase. The loss quantity of laccase was calculated to be approximate 12%. The weight percentages of laccase in HKUST-1 was consistent with the encapsulation yield of laccase determined by Pierce" BCA protein measurement (14.75%).

### Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite 2

Further morphology and crystallinity of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results of morphology of HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 were shown in Fig. 5. HKUST-1 were regular acicular structures (Fig. 5a), exhibiting average sizes of 1 mm. Different from the HKUST-1, laccase@HKUST-1 (Fig. 5b) formed microflower whose broad particle size distribution range from 1 to 1.5 mm. These different morphologies of HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite were attributed to aggregative growth kinetics mediated by laccase, which made the formation of microflower structure become possible. Laccase@HKUST-1 was further investigated by transmission electron microscope (TEM). As displayed in Fig. 5c, it exhibited the same morphology with the SEM images of laccase@HKUST-1. From the XRD patterns of HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 (Fig. 5d), we could clearly see that there was no visible difference with regard to the crystalline structure between the pure HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite because the positions of all diffraction peaks matched well. The results showed that the structural integrity and crystalline form of HKUST-1 could be preserved in the presence of laccase.

For the morphology study of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, the synthesis of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was conducted at various BTC and Cu\({}^{2+}\) concentrations. As presented in Fig. 6, there was a great variation in morphology of the resulting laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite by means of regulating the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion. Highly elaborate microflowers were formed at lower

concentrations of organic BTC ligand and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion. Upon an increase in the concentrations of organic BTC ligand and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion to 62.5 mM and 100 mM, respectively, nanoparticles would be generated instead of microflowers. These microflowers with insufficient blooming morphology were observed when the concentrations of organic BTC ligand and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion were lower than 62.5 mM and 100 mM, respectively. This microflower structure of increase@HKUST-1 afforded a high exposed surface area and enabled a greater chance for effective interaction with substrate (Cui et al., 2017). All these observations suggested the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion responded to the morphology of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, and further affects the activity of encapsulated laccase.

### Optimal pH and temperature

It is well known that the catalytic activity of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 is dependent on reaction conditions. To obtain the maximum activity of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1, the effects of reaction pH and temperature on catalytic activity of free laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 7a, the maximum activity for laccase@HKUST-1 was achieved at pH 4, which was identical with that of laccase. When the pH was above or below 4, the catalytic activity of both laccase@HKUST-1 and laccase exhibited a downward trend. Interestingly, laccase@HKUST-1 expressed a much higher activity than laccase under identical pH conditions. For example, laccase@HKUST-1 maintained 78.7 +- 0.9% and 75.3 +- 0.8% of its maximum activity at pH 3.0 and 5.5, respectively. However, laccase retain only 45.3 +- 1.2% and 42.2 +- 0.9% activity, correspondingly (_p_ <= 0.05).

These higher catalytic activities for laccase@HKUST-1 arose from the suitable buffering function of HKUST-1 (Nguyen et al., 2016) and positive effects of cofactor Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion on the enzymatic activity (Khambahy et al., 2015; Rong et al., 2017).

### Optimal pH and temperature 2

The temperature-dependent activity of the pristine laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was also conducted in the temperature range from 30 to 70 degC. The results indicated that the optimum temperature for laccase was 50 degC, and when the temperature above 50 degC, the catalytic activity of pristine laccase significantly decreased. Compared with laccase, laccase@HKUST-1 had the highest catalytic activity at the temperature as high as 60 degC (\(p\leq 0.05\)), which proved that the protective effect of the HKUST-1 coating that limited the flexibility of laccase, subsequently preventing laccase from heat-induced denaturation (Liang et al., 2019; Mohammad et al., 2019; Asgher et al., 2017b).

To better understand the effect of HKUST-1 to the substrate binding efficiency of laccase and catalytic efficiency (Shown Table 1 and Fig. S2), the kinetic parameters and K\({}_{\text{out}}\)/K\({}_{\text{in}}\) of both laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were studied in this work. The K\({}_{\text{in}}\) for laccase was 0.0251 gL\({}^{-1}\). A decrease in K\({}_{\text{in}}\) for laccase@HKUST-1 was presented, suggesting that laccase@HKUST-1 had stronger affinity to the substrate in comparison with free laccase. After the encapsulation of laccase by HKUST-1, HKUST-1 created a microenvironment which made the encapsulated laccase effectively contact with substrate. In terms of the catalytic efficiency, K\({}_{\text{out}}\)/K\({}_{\text{in}}\) for laccase@HKUST-1 improved by nearly 4 times of that for the laccase. The result indicated the enhance of laccase activity to convert substrate into product, which might be related to higher surface area of the unique flower-like structure and the presence of cofactor Cu\({}^{2+}\) ions. The stronger affinity of laccase@HKUST-1 to substrate, together with the improved activity, confirmed the favorable effect of HKUST-1.

### Stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite

Exposure of the enzyme to harsh environments (for example, acidic conditions, elevated temperatures, and organic solvents) typically results in loss of activity. The better stability of encapsulated enzymes was an essential criterion for industrial applications. In order to obtain an insight into the efficiency of HKUST-1 shell to increase the acidic stability of activity, we tested the activity of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 after incubation for 1 h under different acidic conditions. As demonstrated in Fig. 8a, under acidic conditions, the HKUST-1 made laccase more active than free laccase (\(p\leq~{}0.05\)). This is because the acidic material HKUST-1 has a protective effect on laccase.

Temperature induced denaturation of laccase was also a major concern when considering the wide range of industrial applications of enzymes. As shown in Fig. 8b, the laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 revealed their highest thermo-stability at 30 degC and 35 degC, respectively. Moreover, the activity of laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than that of laccase at each temperature. F. (Lassoune et al. (2019)) reported that the immobilization of laccase by glutaraldehyde cross-linking into Calginate beads exhibited 25% activity at 60 degC. Whereas, in our study, at the same temperature, the laccase@HKUST-1 could maintain more than 42.8 \(\pm\) 1.2% activity (\(p\leq 0.05\)). By comparing the residual activity between the biomimetic mineralization method and the cross-linking method, we could find that the thermo-stability by biomimetic mineralization approach was excellent and much better than that by cross-linking method. This phenomenon should be accounted for the following reasons. In solution, high temperature caused the enzyme to aggregate and form a disordered structure. For laccase@HKUST-1, the HKUST-1 coating had a rigid structure, which can limit the flexibility of the enzyme and prevent its folding at high temperatures (Zhao et al., 2011). Thus, the thermal stability of laccase@HKUST-1 increased. The enhancement in the thermal stability of laccase@HKUST-1 was also supported by the stability parameters and change in enthalpy (AH) of the laccase and laccase@HKUST-1, which were present in Tables 2 and 3. Compared thermal denaturation constants (k\({}_{\text{d}}\)) and half-lives (t\({}_{1/2}\)) of laccase@HKUST-1 with that of laccase at the same temperature, laccase@HKUST-1 exhibited a lower k\({}_{\text{d}}\) value than the free enzyme and its t\({}_{1/2}\) value was higher than the free enzyme. This result indicated that laccase@HKUST-1 had a better stability against high temperature. The reason could be seen from the changes in AH value. The AH value of free and encapsulated laccase began to decrease with the increase in the temperature, which proved that the less energy was needed for inactivation of laccase at higher temperature. In addition, at the same temperature, the AH values of laccase@HKUST-1 were higher than that of free enzyme, indicating that the laccase@HKUST-1 required higher energy to inactivate than free laccase. Conversely, laccase@HKUST-1 was more thermally than laccase.

To examine the tolerance of polar solvents including methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methyl cyanide (MeCN) and Dimethyl Formamide (DMF). The laccase@HKUST-1 and laccase were incubated in these polar solvents (30% (v/v) polar solvent and deionized water) for 1 h (see Figure S3). The laccase@HKUST-1 almost did not deactivate under all above polar solvents, while an approximately 40 \(\pm~{}1.2\)% and 75 \(\pm~{}1.5\)% drop in activity of native laccase was observed in MeCN and MeOH, respectively (\(p\leq~{}0.05\)). The possible reason was that the organic solvent deprives the "essential water" of the laccase surface and also caused a change in the laccase conformation. But the HKUST-1 protected the laccase activity by preventing essential water from being deprived, so the tolerance of laccase@HKUST-1 to organic solvent was higher than laccase.

### Stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite 2

Long-term storage stability of laccase@HKUST-1, stored at 4 degC, was checked by assessing its residual activity (Fig. 8c). As expected, laccase@HKUST-1 retained nearly 70 \(\pm~{}1.6\)% of initial viability after 30 days, while free laccase retained only 10 \(\pm~{}1.1\)% of enzyme activity after 30 days (\(p\leq~{}0.05\)). From the result we could know that the excellent durability of the laccase@HKUST-1 revealed great potential in industrial application.

In order to evaluate the reusability of the prepared biocatalyst, laccase@HKUST-1 was separated from the substrate solution after each catalytic reaction, thoroughly washed with deionized water, and finally immersed in fresh substrate for recycling. After being recycled 10 cycles, the residual activity still retained 78.9 \(\pm~{}1.5\)% of the initial activity (The reaction was repeated for 10 times and set the initial activity as 100% activity.) (Fig. 8d, \(p\leq~{}0.05\)). The reason for this phenomenon is that their size is too small, so that part of the laccase@HKUST-1 lost during the recovery process. On the other hand, part of laccase are folded or denatured during the reaction with the substrate, resulting in inactivation.

A. Samui et al. (Samui and Sahu, 2018) investigated the immobilization of laccase on the surface of NH\({}_{2}\)-MIL-53 (Al). Their results showed that the immobilized laccase maintained about 63% of its initial activity after 10 cycles of usage. Compared with the results of previous studies by Arpita Samui et al., the retention of highly active laccase@HKUST-1 at the same number of cycles had a distinctive advantage. The recyclability of laccase@HKUST-1 demonstrates that laccase was properly encapsulated in the HKUST-1 to prevent denaturation and leaching. All of the above results indicated that the protection of laccase by HKUST-1 could greatly improve the stability of laccase, and the feasibility of laccase extended application range in industry.

### BPA degradation by free laccase and immobilized laccase

The degradation efficiency of free laccase for BPA at pH 4.5 and 40 degC during 8 h was compared with that adding ABTS to the reaction system. Laccase/ABTS system showed 50% higher degradation efficiency for BPA than free laccase (Fig. S8). The results showed that the degradation efficiency of BPA with ABTS was significantly higher than that without ABTS. The possible reason was that laccase mediator ABTS could improve the ability of electron transfer during the degradation reaction (Mir-Tutusaus et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2015). Considering higher degradation efficiency for BPA, ABTS was added to the laccase(r) HKUST-1.

To provide the excellent degradation performance, the following experiments were conducted at pH of 6.5. By increasing the temperature to 40 degC, increase and increase@HKUST-1 improved the degradation efficiency of BPA to 65% and 98.2%, respectively (Fig. S6). Furthermore, an increase of temperature resulted in a decrease in degradation efficiency of BPA for increase. At a higher temperature, laccase@HKUST-1 did not show a decrease in degradation efficiency. The time course for degrading BPA with laccase@HKUST-1 at 40 degC and pH of 6.5 was then examined (Fig. S7). Laccase@HKUST-1 reached full degradation of BPA at 4 h, while 35.5% degradation efficiency was achieved for laccase at 4 h. The laccase@HKUST-1 gave a lower degradation time than laccase, due to the highly catalytic activity and enhancement of stability.

The adsorption of laccase@HKUST-1 was also tested with the thermal inactivated laccase. Fig. 9 showed that around 25% removal for BPA was achieved via adsorption during 1 h's treatment. In this experiment, the removal for BPA after 4 h by free laccase was 35.5%. In contrast, with the exception of adsorption, the removal for BPA after 4 h by laccase@HKUST-1 was 74.2%. Therefore, the removal for BPA by laccase@HKUST-1 is still higher than that of laccase. In other words, the activity of laccase@HKUST-1 is higher than laccase.

The reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 was carried out in degradation of BPA at 40 degC for 4 h. In each cycle of degradation, laccase@HKUST-1 could be easily recovered through centrifugation, followed by washing with water. Then the obtained laccase@HKUST-1 was used to start the new cycle of degradation of BPA. As evident from the Fig. Sd, after 8 cycles of degradation, a loss of only 12% of its original degradation efficiency was displayed by the laccase@HKUST-1. Further studies showed the laccase@HKUST-1 still maintained 75.9% of its original degradation efficiency after 10 cycles (Fig. 10). This good recycling performance of laccase@HKUST-1 was very beneficial for reducing the cost of BPA degradation.

## 4 Conclusions

In conclusion, we first investigated the synthesis of laccase@HKUST-1 by using HKUST-1 to encapsulate laccase. HKUST-1 was an acidic material, which allowed laccase to react at optimal pH and protected it in extreme environments. In addition, copper was a cofactor of laccase, and the copper in laccase@HKUST-1 could also increase the activity of laccase. In this experiment, laccase@HKUST-1 demonstrated better pH stability, thermal stability and storage stability compared to free laccase, and had good practical potential in the treatment of industrial BPA wastewater. Accordingly, the method of employing HKUST-1 as a protective layer to protect the laccase against industrial environment provides the possibility to further develop bio-composite for industrial applications.

# Preparation of HKUST-1

The preparation of the HKUT-1 was based on the method reported earlier with slight modification. Cupric acetate monohydrate (87.5 mmol) and 1,3,5-benzentericboxylicacid (BTC) (25 mmol) were dissolved in NaAc-HAc buffer solution (200 mM, pH 7, 1 L), respectively. Then 0.25 ml BTC solution was added into 0.25 ml cupric acetate monohydrate solution, and incubated under 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 8 h. Subsequently, the product was obtained by centrifuging and washed three times with deionized water. Eventually, Dried in vacuum freeze dryer for 12 h and saved at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

# Fabrication of laccase@HKUST-1

Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was fabricated by using the biomimetic mineralization method. The method, which was based on previously reported, was following. Mixture A was prepared by adding cupric acetate monohydrate solution (87.5 mM, 250 \(\mu\)L) into the solution of laccase (2 mg, 20 \(\mu\)l). Solution B was obtained by dissolving BTC (25 mM, 250 \(\mu\)L) in the acetate buffer saline solution (pH 7.0, 200 mM). Then solution A and solution B were mixed and incubated under 30 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 8 h for the formation of HKUST-1 protective coatings. Then the solids were separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min. The solids were washed three times by deionized water. Eventually, Dried in vacuum freeze dryer for 12 h and saved at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

# Activity assay

The activity of free laccase was determined by the principle of laccase oxidation ABTS. Formation of the cation radical was monitored at 420 nm (\(\xi_{420}\) = 36.0 mM-1 cm-1) at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. In terms of free laccase, the reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 0.005 mg of free laccase. So, for the immobilized laccase containing 0.005 mg free laccase was incubated in 0.5 ml ABTS solution at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Prior to the UV test, the suspended solid was precipitated by centrifugation. In this work, one enzyme activity unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to oxidize 1 \(\mu\)mol of ABTS per minute. The activity was calculated according to the following equation:

\[U=\frac{\Delta\text{A}\times\text{V}\times 10^{6}}{\varepsilon\times\text{L} \times\text{t}}\times 100\%\]

In this work, \(\Delta\text{A}=\) the variation of absorbance before and after of the reaction, V (L)= the volume of liquid in cuvette, \(\xi=\) the extinction coefficient, L (cm)= the length of cuvette's optical path and t (min)= the reaction time.

# Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1

The morphologies and detailed structure of HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite were recorded by JSM-6010 PLUS/LA scanning electron microscope (SEM) and FEI Tecnai G2 S-TWIN F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM). The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were collected by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6100Lab, Japan) with scattering angles (20) of 10-80 \({}^{\circ}\) at a scanrate of 2 \({}^{\circ}\)/min. Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were obtained on a Nicolet Nexus 470 Spectrometer in the range of 400-4000 cm-1 by using KBr pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a STA449C Thermal Analyzer.

### Tolerance of organic solvents

Free laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were incubated in 30 % (v/v) organic solvent and deionized water for 1 h, in which methyl cyanide (MeCN), methanol (MeOH), dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Dimethyl Formamide (DMF) and ethanol (EtOH) was used as organic solvent. The tolerance of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 to organic solvents were tested by comparing their residual activity.

### Storage stability

The storage stability of free and immobilized laccase at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C were examined by comparing their residual activity. Finally, set the initial activity (first day activity) as 100% activity.

### Operational stability

The reusability of the laccase@HKUST-1 was assessed by recycling 10 times. After reaction, the laccase@HKUST-1 was separated by centrifuging, washed with deionized water, and reused for next reaction. The reaction was repeated for 10 times and set the initial activity as 100 % activity.

### BPA removal experiments and BPA detection

We investigated the effects of BPA concentrations (25 - 400 mg/L), reaction pH (4.5 - 7), reaction temperature (20 - 60 \({}^{\circ}\)C) and reaction time (1 - 24 h) on the degradation of BPA. The method as following, laccase and laccase@HKUAT-1 containing the same mass of enzyme (approximately contained 0.2 g laccase) were added to the BPA solution and the BPA was degraded according to the above variables. In order to speed up the reaction, we added ABTS to the reaction system.

The residual amounts of BPA in the samples were analyzed by using a high efficiency liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a quaternary pump, diode array detector (DAD) and an Ascentis(r) C18 column (4.6 mm\(\times\)250 mm, 5 \(\upmu\)m) and thermostatic at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The mobile phase was water:methanol (40 : 60, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL\(\cdot\)min-1 for 16 min. Spectrophotometric detection was performed at 277 nm.
