# Abstract
Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was synthesized through a biomimetic mineralization process. The integration of laccase and HKUST-1, which contains the cofactor Ca2+, resulted in a 1.5-fold enhancement in catalytic activity compared to free laccase. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was able to function as an active biocatalyst under biologically challenging conditions, such as acidic conditions, high temperature, organic solvents, and continuous operation. The oxidation of phenols, including BPA, with laccase@HKUST-1 reached higher catalytic performance than free laccase and achieved 100% degradation efficiency within 4 hours. This study provides a feasible method to improve the activity and stability of laccase, enabling the complete removal of BPA from the environment.
## 1 Introduction
Enzymes are green biocatalysts with high catalytic efficiency, lower energy requirement, mild reaction conditions, and less by-product. They have numerous applications, including pollutant removal, biomass degradation, drug synthesis, and chemical sensing. However, enzymes are expensive and fragile, limiting their practical application. Immobilizing enzymes on solid supports, such as synthetic polymers, magnetic nanoparticles, silica materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), can enhance their stability and recovery, promoting their development and application. MOFs are porous materials with high stability, tunable pore size, large pore volume, high surface area, and mild synthesis conditions, making them an attractive carrier for enzyme immobilization. Recent reports have explored the use of MOFs for encapsulating horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase (GOx), and cytochrome c (Cyt c) via biomimetic mineralization. This approach has enhanced the stability and reusability of enzymes encapsulated in MOFs. However, preparing enzyme@MOFs with enhanced catalytic activity remains a challenge. Using enzyme active center (metal ions or ligands) as inorganic/organic components to construct MOFs can exhibit enzyme-like activity, offering a promising approach for preparing enzyme@MOFs with enhanced catalytic activity. Laccase, a blue multi-copper oxidase, can degrade bisphenol A (BPA) in an environmentally friendly way. To enhance laccase's activity and stability, researchers encapsulated it in a copper-based metal-organic framework (MOF) called HKUST-1. The MOF acted as a protective layer against high temperatures, continuous operation, and long-term storage, and its flower-like structure and high exposed surface area made the laccase's active site more accessible. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite showed enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and reusability compared to other conventional polymers or inorganic carriers, highlighting MOFs' potential for enzyme encapsulation.
### Materials
The materials used in this study include laccase (0.5 Umg-1, EC 1.10.3.2) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, 98%) from Sigma-Aldrich Co., 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylicacid (C9H0Co9, 98%) from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd., cupric acetate monohydrate (CuCH3COO)2H2O2,0 > 98%) from Sinopham (Shanghai, China) Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., bisphenol A (BPA: (CH3)2C(C6H4OH)2, 99%) from Aladdin, and all other chemicals (analytical grade) from Sinopham (Shanghai, China) Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The enzyme laccase was from _Tranetes versicolar_.
The effect of metal ions and different metal organic frameworks on laccase activity was studied using controlled experiments. Free laccase solution (50 uL) and NaAc-HAc buffer solution (300 uL, pH 4) were added to two control experiments. One group received 100 uL deionized water and 100 uL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1 M), while the other group received 100 uL deionized water and 100 uL of a metal ion solution (Cu2+, Zn2+, Li+, Mg2+, K+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni+, or Fe2+ at 6.25 mM) for 0.5 h at 30 degC. The activity of the laccase was measured using ABTS at 40 degC. Two metal-organic frameworks, HKUST-1 and Zn-MOF, were used to immobilize laccase and their activity was measured.
### Enzyme loading
The encapsulation yield of laccase in HKUST-1 was measured using the Pierce=BCA protein assay. The encapsulation yield is defined as the ratio of the amount of laccase in the laccase@HKUST-1 to the initial amount of laccase. The equation used to calculate the encapsulation yield is: Encapsulationyield (%) = (m - C1V1) / m x 100%, where m (mg) is the mass of laccase initially added to the solution, C1 (mg/mL) is the laccase concentration of supernatant, and V1 (mL) is the volume of supernatant.
Effects of pH and temperature :The effects of pH and temperature on free and immobilized laccase were studied by measuring the activity in different pH values (pH 3-6.5) and different temperatures (30-70 degC). The activity was detected using the method mentioned above. The encapsulation yield was tested, and the laccase content in free and immobilized laccase was consistent. The concentration of laccase in free and immobilized laccase solution was 0.1 mg/ml. In the following experiments, the concentration of laccase was the same as above.
### Thermal stability and pH stability
The thermal stability and pH stability of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were examined. Thermal denaturation kinetics were studied by measuring residual activity after 1 h incubation at 30-70 degC. The thermal denaturation constants (k4) were calculated using a first-order exponential equation. The half-life (t1/2) of laccase thermal denaturation was calculated using formula (2). The activation energy (Ed) of laccase thermal denaturation was calculated using the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)). The enthalpy (AH, kJ-mol-1) for laccase thermal denaturation was calculated using formula (4). The pH stability of free and immobilized laccase were examined by incubating them in NaAc-HAc solution with different pH values (pH 4-7) for 1 h. The activity was determined under the optimal conditions. Taking the optimum activity of laccase@HKUST-1 as 100%.
Calculation of the kinetic parameters: The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction were calculated by non-linear curve fitting of the plot of the reaction rate versus substrate concentrations. The equation used for the calculation was: 1/V0 = Km/Vm \* 1/[S] + 1/Vm Where, V0 is the initial catalytic rate, Vm is the maximum rate conversion, [S] is the initial substrate concentration, and Km is the Michealis-Menten constant. The values of Km and Vm were determined by fitting the equation to the experimental data.
### Data analysis
The data obtained from the three parallel experiments were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Origin. The average and standard deviation of the replicates were calculated. Student's t-test was used to determine the significance of the differences observed. A criterion of significance of p <= 0.05 was adopted.
#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite
The laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite was prepared through biomimetic mineralization using the metal-organic framework (MOF) HKUST-1 as a protective layer. The MOF was synthesized using the metal salt Copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O) and the linker 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp) in water at room temperature. The laccase enzyme was incubated with the MOF solution, and the resulting biocomposite was washed and dried. The laccase activity assay was performed in EDTA solution, solutions of various metal ions, and different MOFs. The results showed that the laccase activity was not significantly affected by the presence of EDTA, and that the addition of Cu2+ ions had a positive effect on the catalytic activity of laccase, with an enhancement of 156 ± 1.3% compared to the original activity. The laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite showed an enhancement of 150 ± 1.3% in catalytic activity compared to the laccase(r)Zn-MOF (Zn+ ion had a negligible effect on the catalytic activity of laccase). The synthetic mechanism of laccase(r)HKUST-1 was proposed to be the coordination of amide groups in the laccase surface with metal ions, which acted as specific nucleation points to start the biomineralization of MOFs. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was prepared by encapsulating laccase enzyme within the HKUST-1 metal-organic framework (MOF). The optimal concentration of laccase for encapsulation was determined to be 2 mg/mL, which resulted in 153.1 +- 1.6% activity and 56.1 +- 1.4% (147.5 +- 2.1 mgg-1) encapsulation yield. The incubation time of 8 h was found to be the most effective for encapsulating laccase, resulting in 153 +- 2.1% and 53.4 +- 1.8% activity and encapsulation yield, respectively. The pH of the acetate buffer solution was found to be 6.5, which was suitable for the formation of the HKUST-1 protective layer.
### Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite
Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was characterized by FT-IR spectrum and EDS. FT-IR spectrum showed the presence of laccase in HKUST-1 with peaks at 1657.43 cm-1, 1029.93 cm-1, and 1544.56 cm-1, indicating the successful encapsulation of laccase. EDS confirmed the presence of N element, further supporting the encapsulation of laccase. TGA curves were used to determine the quantity of laccase within laccase@HKUST-1, with a loss quantity of approximately 12%. The weight percentages of laccase in HKUST-1 was consistent with the encapsulation yield determined by Pierce's BCA protein measurement (14.75%). The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was characterized using SEM, TEM, and XRD. The results showed that the biocomposite had a microflower structure with a broad particle size distribution range of 1-1.5 mm. The TEM image showed the same morphology as the SEM image. The XRD pattern showed no visible difference in the crystalline structure between the pure HKUST-1 and the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, indicating that the structural integrity and crystalline form of HKUST-1 were preserved in the presence of laccase. The synthesis of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was conducted at various BTC and Cu2+ concentrations, and the results showed that the morphology of the resulting biocomposite varied greatly with the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu2+ ion. Highly elaborate microflowers were formed at lower concentrations of organic BTC ligand and Cu2+ ion, while nanoparticles were generated at higher concentrations. These observations suggested that the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu2+ ion affected the morphology of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, which in turn affected the activity of the encapsulated laccase.
### Optimal pH and temperature
The maximum activity of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 was achieved at pH 4. The catalytic activity of both laccase@HKUST-1 and laccase decreased when the pH was above or below 4. Laccase@HKUST-1 expressed higher activity than laccase under identical pH conditions. At pH 3.0 and 5.5, laccase@HKUST-1 maintained 78.7 +- 0.9% and 75.3 +- 0.8% of its maximum activity, respectively, while laccase retained only 45.3 +- 1.2% and 42.2 +- 0.9% activity, respectively. The suitable buffering function of HKUST-1 and positive effects of cofactor Cu\({}^{2+}\) ion on the enzymatic activity contributed to the higher catalytic activities of laccase@HKUST-1. The optimal temperature for laccase was 50 degC, and laccase@HKUST-1 had the highest catalytic activity at 60 degC. The K\({}_{\text{in}}\) for laccase was 0.0251 gL\({}^{-1}\), and it decreased for laccase@HKUST-1, indicating a stronger affinity to the substrate. The K\({}_{\text{out}}\)/K\({}_{\text{in}}\) for laccase@HKUST-1 improved by nearly 4 times that of laccase. The results confirmed the favorable effect of HKUST-1 on laccase activity.
### Stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite
Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite showed improved stability and reusability compared to free laccase. At acidic pH (3.5-5.5), laccase@HKUST-1 had higher activity than free laccase. At temperatures 30-35 degC, laccase@HKUST-1 had higher thermostability than free laccase. Laccase@HKUST-1 also showed higher tolerance to organic solvents (MeOH, EtOH, DCM, DMSO, MeCN, DMF) than free laccase, with almost no deactivation in 30% (v/v) polar solvents. The enhancement in stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 was attributed to the protective effect of HKUST-1 shell, which limited the flexibility of the enzyme and prevented its folding at high temperatures, and also prevented the deprivation of "essential water" from the laccase surface in organic solvents. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite showed excellent stability and reusability. After 30 days of storage at 4°C, the residual activity of laccase@HKUST-1 was nearly 70% of the initial activity, while free laccase retained only 10% of its activity. The reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 was evaluated by recycling it 10 times, and the residual activity still retained 78.9% of the initial activity. The immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 protected the enzyme from denaturation and leaching, resulting in improved stability and reusability. The kinetic parameters of free laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 are shown in Table 1. The Kd value of laccase@HKUST-1 was lower than that of free laccase, indicating that the immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 improved its affinity for the substrate. The Kout value of laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than that of free laccase, indicating that the immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 improved its stability and reduced its inactivation rate. The Vd value of laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than that of free laccase, indicating that the immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 improved its catalytic activity. The Kout/Kin value of laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than that of free laccase, indicating that the immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 improved its stability and reduced its inactivation rate.
### BPA degradation by free laccase and immobilized laccase
Laccase@HKUST-1, a nanoscale metal-organic framework, was synthesized and used for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). The degradation efficiency of free laccase and immobilized laccase (laccase@HKUST-1) was compared at pH 4.5 and 40 degC for 8 hours. The results showed that laccase@HKUST-1 had a 50% higher degradation efficiency than free laccase. The addition of ABTS (a laccase mediator) further improved the degradation efficiency of BPA with laccase@HKUST-1. The degradation efficiency of BPA was also studied at different temperatures, and the results showed that laccase@HKUST-1 had a higher degradation efficiency than free laccase at 40 degC. The adsorption of laccase@HKUST-1 was tested, and the results showed that it had a higher removal efficiency than free laccase. The reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 was also studied, and the results showed that it could be easily recovered and reused for BPA degradation without significant loss of its original degradation efficiency.
## 4 Conclusions
Laccase@HKUST-1, a nanoscale metal-organic framework, was synthesized by encapsulating laccase in HKUST-1, an acidic material. The composite demonstrated better pH stability, thermal stability, and storage stability compared to free laccase and showed potential in treating industrial BPA wastewater. The method of using HKUST-1 as a protective layer to protect laccase against industrial environments provides possibilities for further developing bio-composites for industrial applications.

The product was obtained by centrifuging and washing three times with deionized water. It was then dried in a vacuum freeze dryer for 12 hours and stored at 4°C.
Fabrication of laccase@HKUST-1: Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was fabricated using the biomimetic mineralization method. The method involved preparing mixture A by adding cupric acetate monohydrate solution (87.5 mM, 250 μL) to laccase (2 mg, 20 μL) and mixing solution B by dissolving BTC (25 mM, 250 μL) in acetate buffer saline solution (pH 7.0, 200 mM).

# Activity assay
The activity of free laccase was determined using the principle of laccase oxidation ABTS. The reaction mixture contained 0.005 mg of free laccase in 0.5 ml ABTS solution at 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
