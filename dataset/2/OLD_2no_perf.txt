# Abstract
A biomimetic mineralization process was used to synthesize laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, which enhanced the catalytic activity of laccase by 1.5-fold compared to free laccase. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was able to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) with 100% degradation efficiency within 4 hours, and showed improved stability and activity under acidic conditions, high temperatures, organic solvents, and continuous operation. The synergistic enhancement of substrate oxidation was due to the integration of laccase and HKUST-1 containing cofactor Ca2+. This study demonstrates a feasible method to improve the activity and stability of laccase, enabling the complete removal of BPA from the environment.
## 1 Introduction
Enzymes are green biocatalysts with high catalytic efficiency, lower energy requirement, mild reaction conditions, and less by-product. They have numerous applications, including pollutant removal, biomass degradation, drug synthesis, and chemical sensing. However, enzymes are expensive and fragile, hampering their practical application. Enzyme immobilization on solid supports enhances their stability and recovery, stimulating their developments and applications. Various carriers, such as synthetic polymers, magnetic nanoparticles, silica materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been explored for enzyme immobilization. MOFs are a popular choice due to their high stability, tunable pore size, large pore volume, high surface area, and mild synthesis conditions. MOFs can facilitate mass transfer while offering superior chemical and thermal protection. Recent reports have explored the usage of MOFs for encapsulating horseradish peroxidase (HRP), glucose oxidase (GOx), and cytochrome c (Cyt c) via biomimetic mineralization. Enzymes encapsulated in MOFs have enhanced stability and reusability, due to reduced mobility and easy recycling via centrifugation. However, immobilized enzymes with enhanced catalytic activity are still in high demand but challenging to achieve. Using enzyme active center (metal ions or ligands) as inorganic/organic components constructs MOFs, which can exhibit enzyme-like activity. This strategy offers a promising approach for preparing enzyme@MOFs with enhanced catalytic activity.
## 1 Introduction 2
The study discusses the enhancement of laccase activity and stability through encapsulation in a copper-based metal-organic framework (MOF) called HKUST-1. The MOF acts as a protective layer, enhancing the accessibility of the enzyme's active site and improving its catalytic activity, stability, and reusability. The encapsulation process involves the interaction of copper ions from the laccase active center with the HKUST-1 framework, creating a laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite. The study highlights the superior performance of MOFs for enzyme encapsulation compared to conventional polymers or inorganic carriers. The findings suggest that the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite can be used for the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA), a toxic compound released from consumer products, in a cost-effective and safe manner.
### Materials
The enzyme used in this study was laccase (0.5 U/mg-1, EC 1.10.3.2), which was extracted from Tranetes versicolar and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The substrate used was 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS, 98%), also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. The metal salt used was copper(II) acetate monohydrate (CuCH3COO)2H2O2, with a purity of > 98%, purchased from Sinopham (Shanghai, China) Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. The linker used was 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (C9H0Co9, 98%), obtained from Jinan Henghua Sci. & Tec. Co. Ltd. The enzyme concentration was 0.5 U/mg-1, and the substrate concentration was 1 mM. The reaction was carried out at pH 4.5, and the temperature was 25 degC. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm, and the enzymatic activity was calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The resulting peroxidase-encapsulated MOF composite (OPP-MOF) was used to degrade dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and congo red (CR).
### Effect of metal ions and different metal organic frameworks on laccase activity
The activity of laccase was studied using different metal ions and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The activity was measured by exposing the enzyme to various metal ion solutions (Cu2+, Zn2+, Li+, Mg2+, K+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni+, and Fe2+) at a concentration of 6.25 mM for 0.5 hours at 30 degrees Celsius. The two MOFs used for immobilizing laccase were HKUST-1 and Zn-MOF. The activity of the immobilized laccase was measured using ABTS as a substrate at 40 degrees Celsius. The results showed that the activity of laccase was affected by the presence of metal ions and MOFs. The optimal activity was achieved with HKUST-1, which had a higher activity than Zn-MOF. The study suggests that HKUST-1 is a suitable MOF for immobilizing laccase and enhancing its activity.
### Enzyme loading
The encapsulation yield of laccase in HKUST-1 was measured using Pierce=BCA protein assay. The encapsulation yield is defined as the ratio of laccase amount in laccase@HKUST-1 to the initial amount of laccase. The formula used to calculate encapsulation yield is: Encapsulationyield (%) = (m - C1V1) / m x 100%, where m (mg) is the mass of laccase initially added to the solution, C1 (mg/mL) is the laccase concentration of supernatant, and V1 (mL) is the volume of supernatant.
### Effects of pH and temperature
The effects of pH and temperature on free and immobilized laccase were studied by measuring the activity in different pH values (pH 3-6.5) and different temperatures (30-70 degC). The activity was detected using a method mentioned earlier. The optimum activity of laccase@HKUST-1 was taken as 100%. The encapsulation yield was tested, and the laccase content in free and immobilized laccase was consistent, with a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. The same concentration was used in the following experiments.
### Thermal stability and pH stability
The thermal stability of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 was examined by measuring the residual activity after incubation for 1 h at 30-70 degC. The thermal denaturation kinetics were expressed by a first-order exponential equation, and the thermal denaturation constants (k4) were calculated according to the equation. The half-life (t1/2) of laccase thermal denaturation was calculated using formula (2). The activation energy (Ed) of laccase thermal denaturation was calculated by the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (3)), and the enthalpy (AH, kJ-mol-1) for laccase thermal denaturation was calculated according to formula (4). The pH stability of free and immobilized laccase was examined by incubating free and immobilized laccase in NaAc-HAc solution with different pH values (pH 4-7) for 1 h respectively. The activity was determined under the optimal conditions, with the optimum activity of laccase@HKUST-1 taken as 100%.
### Calculation of the kinetic parameters
The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reaction were calculated by non-linear curve fitting of the plot of the reaction rate versus substrate concentrations. The Michaelis-Menten equation was used to model the reaction kinetics, with the maximum rate conversion (Vm) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) being determined from the fit. The initial catalytic rate (V0) and the initial substrate concentration ([S]) were also determined from the fit. The values of V0, Vm, Km, and [S] were used to calculate the kinetic parameters of the reaction.
### Data analysis
In this study, the data obtained from three parallel experiments were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and Origin. The average and standard deviation of the replicates were calculated. Student's t-test was used to determine whether the differences in the data were significant, with a criterion of significance set at p <= 0.05. The enzyme activity was measured in terms of the rate of substrate conversion, and the Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters were determined for both the free and immobilized enzyme. The thermal stability of the enzyme was evaluated by measuring the enzyme activity at different temperatures, and the half-life and deactivation energy were calculated. The immobilized enzyme was found to have improved thermal stability and activity compared to the free enzyme. Additionally, the immobilized enzyme was able to degrade methylene blue and congo red dyes, indicating its potential for use in bioremediation applications.
#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite
The laccase enzyme was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) called HKUST-1, which contains copper ions as the active center. The resulting laccase-MOF composite (laccase(r)HKUST-1) showed an enhancement in catalytic activity by 150 +- 1.3% compared to the laccase-Zn-MOF (Zn+ ion had a negligible effect on the catalytic activity of laccase). The enhancement in activity was attributed to the synergistic effect between laccase and copper ions, where the copper ions activated the laccase activity and accelerated the transfer of electrons between the laccase active centers. The synthetic mechanism of laccase(r)HKUST-1 was proposed to be the coordination of amide groups in the laccase surface with metal ions, which acted as specific nucleation points to start the biomineralization of MOFs. The work highlighted a valuable strategy to enhance laccase activity by building a bridge of cooperation between laccase and HKUST-1, using the MOF containing cofactor Cu2+ as carriers for laccase encapsulation.
#### Preparation of laccase(r)HKUST-1 biocomposite 2
The preparation of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite involved the encapsulation of laccase enzyme within HKUST-1 metal-organic framework (MOF) using acetate buffer solution at pH 6.5. The optimal laccase concentration for encapsulation was found to be 2 mg/mL, resulting in 153.1 +- 1.6% activity and 56.1 +- 1.4% (147.5 +- 2.1 mgg-1) encapsulation yield. An incubation time of 8 h was also found to be optimal for laccase encapsulation, resulting in 153 +- 2.1% activity and 53.4 +- 1.8% encapsulation yield. The resulting laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite had a high encapsulation yield and activity, indicating the successful formation of the MOF layer around the enzyme.
### Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite
The laccase enzyme was successfully encapsulated within HKUST-1, a metal-organic framework (MOF), as confirmed by FT-IR spectrum. The FT-IR spectrum of laccase@HKUST-1 showed the presence of laccase peaks, including the C=0 stretching vibration peak at 1657.43 cm-1, and the N-H bending vibration and C-N stretching vibration peaks at 1029.93 and 1544.56 cm-1, respectively. The presence of N element in the EDS spectrum further confirmed the encapsulation of laccase within HKUST-1. The quantity of laccase within laccase@HKUST-1 was determined to be approximately 12% by TGA curves, which was consistent with the encapsulation yield of laccase determined by Pierce's BCA protein measurement (14.75%).
### Characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite 2
The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was characterized using SEM, TEM, and XRD. The results showed that the biocomposite had a microflower structure with a broad particle size distribution range of 1-1.5 mm. The TEM images showed that the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite had the same morphology as the SEM images. The XRD patterns of the pure HKUST-1 and laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite showed no visible difference in the crystalline structure, indicating that the structural integrity and crystalline form of HKUST-1 were preserved in the presence of laccase. The synthesis of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was conducted at various BTC and Cu2+ concentrations, and the results showed that the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu2+ ion affected the morphology of the resulting biocomposite, with highly elaborate microflowers formed at lower concentrations and nanoparticles generated at higher concentrations. The microflower structure of the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite afforded a high exposed surface area and enabled greater interaction with the substrate, suggesting that the concentrations of BTC ligand and Cu2+ ion responded to the morphology of the biocomposite and further affected the activity of the encapsulated laccase.
### Optimal pH and temperature
The laccase enzyme was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) called HKUST-1, creating a composite called laccase@HKUST-1. The optimal pH and temperature for the catalytic activity of laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were investigated. The maximum activity for both laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 was achieved at pH 4. The activity of laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than laccase under the same pH conditions. The activity of laccase@HKUST-1 was also found to be more stable over a wider range of pH values compared to laccase. The thermal stability of laccase@HKUST-1 was also studied using TGA and it was found to be more stable than laccase. The SEM, TEM and XRD patterns of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite, HKUST-1 and standard HKUST-1 were also studied. The results showed that the laccase enzyme was successfully immobilized within the HKUST-1 MOF and the composite had improved catalytic activity and stability compared to free laccase.
### Optimal pH and temperature 2
The laccase enzyme was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) named HKUST-1, creating a composite called laccase@HKUST-1. The optimal temperature for the pristine laccase was 50 degC, but when the temperature exceeded 50 degC, the enzyme's catalytic activity significantly decreased. In contrast, laccase@HKUST-1 had the highest catalytic activity at 60 degC, indicating that the HKUST-1 coating protected the enzyme from heat-induced denaturation. The kinetic parameters and K\({}_{\text{out}}\)/K\({}_{\text{in}}\) of both laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were studied, showing that laccase@HKUST-1 had a stronger affinity to the substrate and improved catalytic efficiency compared to free laccase. The results suggested that HKUST-1 enhanced the activity of laccase and protected it from deactivation at high temperatures.
### Stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite
The laccase enzyme was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) called HKUST-1, which enhanced its stability and activity. The enzyme was tested under acidic conditions and was found to be more active when encapsulated in HKUST-1. The thermo-stability of the enzyme was also improved, with the encapsulated enzyme maintaining more than 42.8% activity at 60 degC, compared to 25% activity for a cross-linked enzyme. The enzyme was also tested for its tolerance to polar solvents, and the results showed that the encapsulated enzyme was more resistant to deactivation by organic solvents than the free enzyme. The enhancement in stability and activity was attributed to the rigid structure of the HKUST-1 coating, which limited the flexibility of the enzyme and prevented its folding at high temperatures. The results suggest that the immobilization of enzymes within MOFs can be a promising approach for improving their stability and activity for industrial applications.
### Stability and reusability of laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite 2
The laccase enzyme was immobilized within HKUST-1, a metal-organic framework (MOF), to create a biocomposite (laccase@HKUST-1) with improved stability and reusability. The immobilization process enhanced the durability of laccase, as shown by the retention of nearly 70% of initial activity after 30 days of storage at 4°C, compared to only 10% retained by free laccase. Additionally, laccase@HKUST-1 demonstrated excellent reusability, retaining 78.9% of its initial activity after 10 cycles of recycling. The kinetic parameters of free laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were compared, showing improved catalytic activity for the immobilized enzyme. The results suggest that laccase@HKUST-1 has great potential for industrial applications due to its stability, reusability, and enhanced catalytic activity.
### BPA degradation by free laccase and immobilized laccase
Laccase@HKUST-1, a composite of laccase enzyme and metal-organic framework (MOF), was synthesized and showed improved degradation efficiency for bisphenol A (BPA) compared to free laccase. The addition of ABTS (2,6-dimethylphenol) as a mediator further enhanced the degradation efficiency of BPA. The optimal conditions for BPA degradation using laccase@HKUST-1 were determined to be pH 6.5 and 40 degC, with a degradation time of 4 h. The adsorption of laccase@HKUST-1 was also tested, and it was found that the removal of BPA by laccase@HKUST-1 was higher than that of free laccase. Additionally, laccase@HKUST-1 showed good recyclability, with only a 12% loss of its original degradation efficiency after 8 cycles of degradation and 75.9% of its original degradation efficiency remaining after 10 cycles.
## 4 Conclusions
Laccase@HKUST-1, a bio-composite, was synthesized by encapsulating laccase within HKUST-1, an acidic MOF. The resulting composite demonstrated improved pH stability, thermal stability, and storage stability compared to free laccase. The presence of copper in laccase@HKUST-1 also enhanced the activity of laccase. The method of using HKUST-1 as a protective layer to protect laccase against industrial environments provides a possibility for further developing bio-composites for industrial applications, such as the treatment of industrial BPA wastewater.
