The Laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity, stability, and reusability compared to free laccase, highlighting the potential of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for enzyme encapsulation. The HKUST-1 MOF, synthesized with a molar ratio of 1:1 between copper(II) chloride and 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane (bpp), had a surface area of 3621 m2/g and a pore size of 0.74 nm. The laccase enzyme was immobilized onto the HKUST-1 MOF via a biomimetic mineralization process, resulting in a stable and reusable biocomposite with a laccase loading of 100 mg/g and a HKUST-1 loading of 100 mg/g. The biocomposite exhibited improved stability and reusability compared to free laccase, with higher activity at acidic pH (3.5-5.5) and higher thermostability at temperatures 30-35°C. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite also showed higher tolerance to organic solvents (MeOH, EtOH, DCM, DMSO, MeCN, DMF) than free laccase, with almost no deactivation in 30% (v/v) polar solvents. The enhancement in stability and reusability was attributed to the protective effect of the HKUST-1 shell, which limited the flexibility of the enzyme and prevented its folding at high temperatures, and also prevented the deprivation of "essential water" from the laccase surface in organic solvents. The kinetic parameters of free laccase and laccase@HKUST-1 were compared, showing that the immobilization of laccase on HKUST-1 improved its affinity for the substrate, stability, and catalytic activity. The laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite was stable and reusable, with no significant loss of activity observed after five consecutive cycles. The study demonstrates the potential of MOFs for enzyme encapsulation and their application in biocatalysis, biosensors, and biomedical applications.

The activity of free laccase was determined using the principle of laccase oxidation ABTS. The reaction mixture contained 0.005 mg of free laccase in 0.5 mL ABTS solution at 40°C. The activity was calculated using the equation: U = (ΔA x V x 10^6) / (ε x L x t) x 100%. Here, ΔA is the variation of absorbance before and after the reaction, V is the volume of liquid in cuvette, ε is the extinction coefficient, L is the length of cuvette's optical path, and t is the reaction time. The immobilized laccase containing 0.005 mg free laccase was incubated in 0.5 mL ABTS solution at 40°C, and the activity was calculated using the same equation.

The characterization of laccase@HKUST-1 was carried out using various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite had a uniform distribution of laccase on the surface of HKUST-1, with no significant changes in the crystal structure of HKUST-1. The FT-IR spectrum revealed the presence of laccase and its interaction with HKUST-1, and the TGA analysis showed that the laccase@HKUST-1 biocomposite had a higher thermal stability than free laccase.

The degradation of BPA was investigated under different conditions of BPA concentration (25-400 mg/L), pH (4.5-7), temperature (20-60 °C), and reaction time (1-24 h) using laccase and laccase@HKUAT-1. The enzyme mass was approximately 0.2 g. The reaction was accelerated by adding ABTS. BPA residual amounts were analyzed using a high-efficiency liquid chromatography system with a quaternary pump, diode array detector, and an Ascentis(r) C18 column. The mobile phase was water:methanol (40:60, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min for 16 min. Detection was performed at 277 nm.
