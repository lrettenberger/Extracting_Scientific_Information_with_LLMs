# Abstract
The peroxidase enzyme from orange peel (Girrus sienes, a fruit waste) was immobilized within metal-organic framework (MOF) via self-assembled biomineralization method. The resulting OPP-MOF composite was confirmed by XRD, FT-IR, and SEM. The half-life of OPP-MOF was determined to be 2.1 folds more stable than free enzyme in the temperature range of 40-60 degC. The Michaels constant (Ksd) and maximum rate (Vmax) values of OPP-MOF were evaluated by Michaels-Menten kinetics studies, showing higher Ksd and lower Vmax compared to native peroxidase. The immobilized OPP-MOF retained 48% residual activity after 6th cycle and showed no significant loss in activity till 18 days of storage. The immobilized OPP-MOF was used for degradation of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) dye, and it was found to be more efficient and rapid.
## Introduction
The immobilization of enzymes within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has gained attention due to its potential to enhance enzyme properties such as thermal stability, storage stability, and reusability. In this study, orange peel peroxidase (OPP) was immobilized within MOF, forming a hybrid composite (OPP-MOF) via a biomineralization process. The characterization of OPP-MOF was performed using XRD, FT-IR, and SEM. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters were determined for OPP-MOF and the free form of peroxidase. Thermo-kinetic studies were carried out to determine the thermal stability of free enzyme and OPP-MOF. The immobilized OPP-MOF was able to degrade dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and congo red (CR). The immobilization of OPP within MOF enhanced its thermal stability, with a higher half-life and deactivation energy compared to the free enzyme. The OPP-MOF composite had a higher activity and stability than the free enzyme, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications.
## Materials
The materials used in this study include fresh unripe oranges (_Citrus sinensis_) purchased from local fruit vendors in Matunga, Mumbai, India, and various chemicals such as zinc acetate, guaiacol, 2-methylimidazole, and hydrogen peroxide obtained from HilMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification. The enzyme extracted from the oranges was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) composite, specifically a zinc-based MOF, ZIF-8, synthesized using zinc acetate and 2-methylimidazole. The immobilization process was carried out under mild conditions and resulted in a stable and reusable enzyme-MOF composite, which was characterized using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters were determined for the free and immobilized enzyme, and the thermal stability was studied using thermal deactivation constant (k\({}_{	ext{d}}\)), half-life (t\({}_{1/2}\)), and deactivation energy (Ea). The immobilized enzyme was found to be more stable and efficient than the free enzyme, and it was able to degrade various dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and congo red (CR) effectively.
### Preparation of peroxidase extract
The preparation of the peroxidase extract involved several steps. First, 10 g of washed orange peels were chopped into small pieces and homogenized in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) using a blender. The homogenate was then filtered through Whatman's filter paper No. 1 and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 20 min at 5 degC. The supernatant was partially purified using 80% ammonium sulphate, and the obtained pellet was re-dissolved and used as the peroxidase source for immobilization.
### Peroxidase activity assay
The peroxidase activity was assessed by measuring the oxidation of guaiacol in the presence of hydrogen peroxidase, which forms tetraquaicol, a brownish product with an absorption coefficient of 26.6 mM^-1 cm^-1 at 470 nm. The enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing one mmol of guaiacol in unit time, and was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. The protein content was estimated using the Bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard.
### OPP-MOF synthesis
The OPP-MOF composite was synthesized by mixing zinc acetate (8 mmol, 14 mL) with an enzyme extract solution (1.2 mg/mL) of 2-methylimidazole water solution (24 mmol, 14 mL) and stirring at 200 rpm at 28 ± 2 degC. The resulting white precipitate was separated by cold centrifugation (8000 x g, 5 degC, 10 min) and washed thrice with DI water. Pure ZIF-8 crystals were synthesized without enzyme for comparison purposes.
### Characterization of OPP-MOF
The characterization of OPP-MOF was done using FT-IR, XRD, SEM, and TGA. FT-IR spectra showed the presence of Zn-N stretching band at 421.75 cm\({}^{-1}\), and the in-plane bending absorption bands were observed at 953.16 and 1308.79 cm\({}^{-1}\). Additionally, two peaks at 2927.43 and 3133.14 cm\({}^{-1}\), respectively, attributed to the aliphatic and aromatic C\(-\)H stretching of the 2-methylimidazole, confirmed the successful synthesis of ZIF-8. The XRD patterns of ZIF-8 and OPP-MOF showed similar diffraction patterns, indicating that the immobilization of OPP did not change the chemical/physical characteristics of ZIF-8. SEM analysis showed that OPP-MOF had a rhombic dodecahedral shape with an average size of 875-975 nm. TGA analysis showed a gradual weight loss up to \({}^{-}\)23.5% till 200 degC, corresponding to evaporation and removal of H\({}_{2}\)O and other organic small molecules from the cavities, and a 9% weight loss occurred in the 2nd decomposition stage (250-350 degC), attributed to the decomposition of protein/enzyme molecules within ZIF-8. These results confirmed the successful encapsulation and immobilization of OPP within ZIF-8 MOF.
### Properties of OPP-MOF
The properties of OPP-MOF were studied, including thermo-stability in the temperature range of 40-60 degC, and the determination of thermal deactivation constant (Kd), half-life (t1/2), and deactivation energy (Ed). Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to evaluate Kd and Vmax for native OPP and OPP-MOF. The OPP-MOF was found to be recyclable up to six repetitive cycles and stable for eighteen days at room temperature. The storage stability was compared with the free form. Experimental procedures are provided in the supplementary information.
### Dye degradation studies
The degradation of Congo red and methylene blue dyes was studied using free OPP and OPP-MOF. The dye solutions were incubated with the enzyme solutions at room temperature for one hour. The decolourization was determined by measuring the absorbance at 495 nm for Congo red and 665 nm for methylene blue using a spectrophotometric method. The results showed that OPP-MOF had 100% residual activity in the first cycle and retained 48% residual activity after six cycles. The SEM images of OPP-MOF after six cycles showed no significant changes in the morphology of the MOF. The decolourization percentage of dye was determined with respect to the buffer.
## 3 Results and discussion
The enzyme orange peel peroxidase (OPP) was immobilized within a metal-organic framework (MOF) using 2-methylimidazole (24 mmol) as the linker. The resulting OPP-MOF composite had a high immobilization yield of 99% and an activity recovery of 9.2 U/mg. The presence of the enzyme molecules induced the formation of a protective framework under physiological conditions, which facilitated crystallization around the biomacromolecules. The OPP-MOF composite was synthesized by mixing the enzyme solution (15 U, 1.2 mg/ml) with the 2-methylimidazole solution and stirring for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation and washing with phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM). The obtained OPP-MOF exhibited activity recovery of 9.2 U/mg.
### Thermal kinetics and stability studies
The immobilization of orange peel peroxidase (OPP) within metal-organic framework (MOF) enhances its thermal stability, with a half-life of 2.8, 2.1, and 1.4 folds higher than free OPP at 40, 50, and 60 degC, respectively. The deactivation constant of immobilized OPP-MOF was found to be much lower than the free peroxidase in the given temperature range. The energy required to deactivate native OPP and OPP-MOF was calculated to be 27.3 and 57.4 kJ mol\({}^{-1}\), respectively, indicating that OPP-MOF required much higher energy to change its 3D structure active conformation. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSIM) images showed that enzyme molecules were encapsulated within ZIF-8 MOF, confirming the framework shielding around the OPP.
### Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters
The Michaelis-Menten parameters (K\({}_{\text{M}}\) and V\({}_{\text{max}}\)) of free and immobilized orange peel peroxidase (OPP) were determined by analyzing the initial rates of reaction with different substrate concentrations. The results showed that the K\({}_{\text{M}}\) value increased after immobilization, indicating a decrease in enzyme affinity for the substrate, possibly due to the encapsulation of OPP in the MOF restricting accessibility. Additionally, the V\({}_{\text{max}}\) value of OPP-MOF was lower than that of the free enzyme, which may be due to conformational changes during immobilization or mass transfer limitations.
### Dye degradation by OPP
The decolourization potential of free OPP and immobilized OPP-MOF was evaluated using two different dyes, methylene blue (MB) and congo red (CR), by incubating them at room temperature (28 ± 2 degC). The percentage decolourization for MB and CR dyes was found to be 88.3% and 93.2% using free enzymes, respectively. On the other hand, OPP-MOF brought about 85.6% and 89.9% decolourization of MB and CR, respectively. The immobilization of peroxidase within MOF has been shown to enhance its stability and activity, as reported by Pandey and co-workers, who obtained nearly 75% decolourization of various dyes using _Azadirachta indica_ peroxidase immobilized onto chitosan within 8 h. Similarly, the reports on manganese peroxidase immobilized within alginate bead showed 78.14% decolourization for Sandal reactive dyes.
### Reusability and storage stability studies
The OPP-MOF composite showed excellent reusability and storage stability. In reusability studies, the residual activity of OPP-MOF was found to be 48% after six successive cycles, indicating that the enzyme did not leach out of the MOF platform. The structure of OPP-MOF remained intact even after six cycles, as observed from SEM images. In storage stability studies, OPP-MOF retained 88% residual activity till 18th day of storage, while free OPP showed a gradual reduction in residual activity. The high storage stability of OPP-MOF was due to the shielding effect of the framework around the enzyme molecules. These results highlight the excellent improvement in chemical and conformational stability after framework formation around OPP embedded within MOF.
## 4 Conclusion
In this study, we successfully prepared a metal-organic framework (MOF) induced by peroxidase from orange peels. The peroxidase enzyme was extracted and immobilized within the MOF via a self-assembled biomineralization method. The resulting OPP-MOF showed improved thermal stability, reusability, and storage stability. Additionally, the OPP-MOF was able to rapidly degrade commercial dyes, demonstrating its potential in bioremediation applications. The enzymatic reaction was characterized by a significant increase in the rate constant (k) and a higher thermal stability (t1/2 and E4) compared to the free enzyme. The immobilization of the peroxidase within the MOF also resulted in a higher reusability and storage stability. The degradation of the dyes was observed to be rapid and efficient, with a higher rate constant (k) and a lower half-life (t1/2) for the OPP-MOF compared to the free enzyme. The results suggest that the prepared OPP-MOF has potential applications in bioremediation and other industrial processes.
### Sds- Page
The enzyme orange peel peroxidase was analyzed using non-reducing SDS PAGE. The enzyme sample (20 μL) was mixed with sample buffer (60 μL) and loaded into each well. A 12% separating gel and a 4% stacking gel were used to achieve proper band separation. The electrophoresis was performed at 120 mV using a Mini Protein Cell II from Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA. Coomassie brilliant blue staining was used to visualize the protein bands.
### Confocal scanning laser microscopy
A mixture of orange peel peroxidase (OPP) tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was synthesized within a zinc-based metal-organic framework (ZIF-8 MOF) using confocal scanning laser microscopy. The enzyme solution (10 mM, pH 9.5 carbonate buffer) was mixed with FITC (8 mg, dissolved in DMSO) and incubated for 4 hours at 250 rpm at ambient temperature in dark conditions. Free FITC was removed via dialysis against DI water and the resulting fluorescently labeled OPP-MOF composite was used for imaging. Confocal scanning laser microscope images were taken using a Leica DMi8 microscope and SP8 scanner.
### Kinetics of thermal deactivation
The thermal deactivation kinetics of the free and immobilized orange peel peroxidase (OPP) were studied at 40, 50, and 60°C in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mM) by withdrawing samples every 10 minutes for 60 minutes and measuring residual enzymatic activity. The inactivation rate constant (k\({}_{\text{d}}\)) was calculated from the slope of the semi-log plot of percent residual activity vs. time, and the time required for the activity to decrease to half its original activity (t\({}_{1/2}\)) was calculated as 0.693/k\({}_{\text{d}}\). The deactivation energy (E\({}_{\text{d}}\)) of the free and immobilized OPP was calculated from Arrhenius plot. The kinetic parameters of free form and OPP were determined using different guicol (substrate) concentrations in the range of 5-120 mM in buffer pH 7.4 at optimum condition. Km and Vmax values of free and immobilized enzyme were calculated from non-linear regression fitting of the initial reaction rates corresponding to different substrate concentrations by Graph Pad Prism software.

The reusability of OPP-MOF was examined by oxidizing guicol in batch operation mode at optimal conditions, and the activity was measured after each cycle. The storage stability of the free and OPP-MOF was evaluated for 18 days by incubating them at room temperature in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) and measuring residual activity every three days.
