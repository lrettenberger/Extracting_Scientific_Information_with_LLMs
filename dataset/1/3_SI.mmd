### Sds- Page

Non-reducing SDS PAGE of the OPP was done as per procedure given by Laemelli [1]. Briefly, enzyme sample (20\(\upmu\)l) was mixed with sample buffer (60\(\upmu\)l) and then it was loaded in each well. Separating gel (12%) and stacking gel (4%) was used to get proper band separation. Mini Protein Cell II from Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA was used for performing the electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was conducted at 120mV. Coomassie brilliant blue staining was done for visualization of protein bands.

### Confocal scanning laser microscopy

Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to investigate the presence of mixture of OPP tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) within the ZIF-8 MOF. The tagging was carried out by mixing enzymes solution (10 mM, pH 9.5 carbonate buffer) and FITC (8 mg, dissolved in DMSO). The solution was incubated for 4 h at 250 rpm at ambient temperature in dark condition. Further, free FITC was removed via dialysis against DI water and subsequent used for synthesis of fluorescently labelled OPP-MOF composite. Laser scanning confocal microscope images were taken on Leica, Germany (DMi8 microscope and SP8 scanner).

### Kinetics of thermal deactivation

OPP-MOF and free form of peroxidase were incubated at 40, 50 and 60\({}^{\circ}\)C in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 of 10 mM). The samples were withdrawn every ten min for 60 min, chilled quickly and then assayed for residual enzymatic activity as mentioned above. A semi-log plot of percent residual activity vs. time was plotted from which the inactivation rate constant (k\({}_{\text{d}}\)) was calculated as the slope, and t\({}_{1/2}\), the time required for the activity to decrease to half its original activity was calculated as 0.693/k\({}_{\text{d}}\). Further, deactivation energy (E\({}_{\text{d}}\)) of the free and immobilized OPP was calculated from Arrhenius plot.
Kinetic parameters of free form and OPP were determined using different guicol (substrate) concentrations in the range of 5-120 mM in buffer pH 7.4 at optimum condition. Km, Vmax values of free and immobilized enzyme were calculated from non-linear regression fitting of the initial reaction rates corresponding to different substrate concentrations by Graph Pad Prism software.

**Reusability studies**

Reusability of OPP-MOF was examined by oxidizing guicol in batch operation mode at optimal conditions. After each cycle, OPP-MOF were separated and washed with sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) and then suspended again in a guicol solution to measure enzyme activity. The activity after each cycle was determined in terms of residual activity by taking the enzyme activity of the first cycle as 100%.

**Storage stability studies**

Storage stabilities of the free and OPP-MOF were evaluated till 18 days by incubating them at room temperature in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) separately. After every three days, free and immobilized OPP were taken out and then assayed for residual activity as mentioned in enzyme activity assay section. The activity was determined in terms of residual activity by considering initial activity as 100%.
