The Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) used in this study is ZIF-8, which was synthesized by mixing 2-methylimidazole (24 mmol) and zinc acetate (8 mmol) with orange peel extract at room temperature within 30 minutes. The resulting OPP-MOF composite showed enhanced thermal stability, storage stability, and reusability for multiple cycles. The immobilized OPP-MOF was used for degradation of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) dye, and it was found to be more efficient and rapid. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters were determined for OPP-MOF and the free form of peroxidase, and thermo-kinetic studies were carried out to determine the thermal stability in terms of thermal deactivation constant (kd), half-life (t1/2) and deactivation energy (Ea). The OPP-MOF composite was characterized using XRD, FT-IR, and SEM. The peroxidase enzyme was extracted from fresh unripe oranges (_Citrus sinensis_) and immobilized within the OPP-MOF composite. The peroxidase activity was assessed by measuring the oxidation of guaiacol in the presence of hydrogen peroxidase, resulting in the formation of tetraquaicol. The enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing one mmol of guaiacol in unit time. The protein content was estimated using the Bradford protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The OPP-MOF synthesis was carried out by mixing zinc acetate (8 mmol, 14 mL) with an enzyme extract solution (containing protein content of 1.2 mg/mL) of 2-methylimidazole water solution (24 mmol, 14 mL) and stirring at 200 rpm at 28 ± 2 degC. The resulting white precipitate was separated by cold centrifugation (8000 x g, 5 degC) for 10 min and washed thrice with DI water. Pure ZIF-8 crystals were synthesized without enzyme for comparison purposes. The XRD patterns of the ZIF-8 and OPP-MOF showed similar diffraction patterns, indicating that the immobilization of OPP did not change the chemical/physical characteristics and properties of the original ZIF-8 MOF. SEM analysis showed that the OPP-MOF had a rhombic dodecahedral shape with a size of approximately 875-975 nm. TGA analysis showed a gradual weight loss up to \({}^{-}\)23.5% till 200 degC, corresponding to evaporation and removal of H\({}_{2}\)O and other organic small molecules from the cavities, and a 9% weight loss occurred in the 2nd decomposition stage (250-350 degC), attributed to the decomposition of protein/enzyme molecules within ZIF-8. These results confirmed the successful encapsulation and immobilization of OPP within ZIF-8 MOF. The immobilized peroxidase enzyme (OPP-MOF) was tested for its ability to degrade Congo red and methylene blue dyes. The dye solutions were prepared at a concentration of 100 ppm in phosphate buffer and were incubated with free OPP and OPP-MOF for one hour at room temperature. The decolourization was measured by spectrophotometry at 495 nm for Congo red and 665 nm for methylene blue. The results showed that OPP-MOF was able to degrade both dyes, with a higher decolourization percentage compared to free OPP. The experiments were done in triplicate and the error bar represents the percentage error in each set of readings. Additionally, the reusability of OPP-MOF was tested up to 6th cycle, with the enzyme retaining 100% residual activity in the first cycle and showing a gradual decrease in activity with increasing cycles. The SEM images of OPP-MOF after 6th cycle showed no significant changes in the morphology of the MOF.
