    "Enzymes immobilized into or onto a smart material have attracted much attention due to their numerous applications as biocatalysts. Recently, microporous metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as active supports for enzyme immobilization owing to their high surface area, high porosity, and tunable functionality. However, challenges remain in the development of MOFs for enzyme immobilization regarding (i) green synthesis approaches, (ii) high loading and activity efficiency, (iii) facile immobilization processes, and (iv) obtaining stable enzyme activity. In this study, we have developed amine-functionalized nanoscale metal organic framework (NMOF) NH2-ML-53(A) as a support for enzyme immobilization using green synthesis in a one-pot procedure. Herein, lacase is immobilized into the NMOFs, which possess highest stability and activity at pH 4-6, using a coprecipitation method. As most reported MOFs are unstable under slightly acidic conditions, developing MOFs that are stable at low pH is challenging. After successful immobilization, it is observed that 625 mg lacase is immobilized per 1 g of NMOF. Importantly, the immobilized enzyme showed good reusability, retaining 63% of its initial activity after being reused 10 times. Our study highlights the development of NMOFs that contain more lacase and retain stability and activity.\n",

    "## 1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme immobilization has received considerable attention in recent years regarding applications in industrial biocatalysis.1, 2, 3 Immobilization can improve the stability and catalytic activity of enzymes, and facilitate their recovery and reuse. Many conventional supports have been developed for enzyme immobilization, including microparticles, silica gel, hydrogels, and porous materials.4, 5, 6 To improve enzyme immobilization, research has focused on developing suitable supports by adjusting different parameters, such as particle size, shape, porosity, surface area, surface charge, surface chemistry, and roughness. However, an ideal support to meet all requirements for efficient enzyme immobilization has yet to be obtained owing to their structures and surface properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are inorganic-organic hybrids comprising metal ions or clusters coordinated with multidentate organic ligands to construct one-, two-, or three-dimensional crystalline structures. Owing to their unique properties, such as well-defined pore structures with large surface areas, high porosity, tunable pore sizes, and suitable thermal stability, MOFs have been extensively studied for diverse applications, such as gas storage/separation, sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Recently, MOFs have been applied as promising materials for enzyme immobilization.13, 14 In the last two years, many research groups, including ourselves, have explored the immobilization of enzymes, including lipase,15, 16 hydrolase,17 urate oxidase,18 glucose oxidase,19 catalase,20 urease,21 and lacase,22 into different MOFs. The resulting enzyme-MOF composites exhibit excellent stability and activity due to the enzyme protection afforded by the frameworks. In particular, recent reports have shown that enzymes can be directly immobilized during MOF crystal formation in a one-step synthesis. For example, Hou _et al._ prepared glucose oxidase-embedded mZIF-8 in one step,23 Wu _et al._ synthesized ZIF-8 embedded with multiple enzymes (glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase) under mild conditions,24 and Nadar _et al._ immobilized glucoamylase into ZF-8 in a one-step synthesis.25 Although these strategies are promising approaches to enzyme immobilization into controlled MOF structures and morphologies, further development is required to produce new biocatalysts.\n",

    "## 1 Introduction 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Laccase (E.C.1.10.3.2, _p_-benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) is a multicomponent oxidase that can oxidize a large number of organic and inorganic substrates, particularly phenols and aromatic amines. Lacase has been used in biosensors, biofuel cells, effluent treatment, and a variety of other applications.26, 27, 28In its native form, laccase application is restricted due to high production costs, low operational stability, and unfavorable recoverability. Laccase immobilization on solid supports can efficiently overcome these disadvantages and has, therefore, received significant attention. Various materials, including chitosan-modified alginate beads,[30] titania nanoparticles,[31] magnetic SiO2,[32, 33] amine-functionalized Fe2O4@C nanoparticles,[34] and EDTA-Cu(n) chelating magnetic nanoparticles,[35] have been used for laccase immobilization and their properties investigated. Among these reported materials, laccase is generally immobilized through tedious multistep approaches. However, developing a smart support that can be synthesized with laccase immobilization in one pot remains a significant challenge. Many researchers have reported that laccase possesses higher activity and stability under acidic conditions (_i.e._, pH 4-6).[36, 37] Therefore, support materials that are stable in this pH range could be significant for the stabilization and activity performance of immobilized laccase. In this context, MOFs with ordered microporous structures, in which enzyme molecules can be homogeneously dispersed within the framework, may be ideal supports for laccase immobilization. However, few reports exist regarding laccase immobilization on MOFs. For example, Pang _et al_ developed bimodal mesoporous Zr-MOF for laccase immobilization _via_ adsorption.[22] Simultaneously, Zhong _et al_. synthesized mesoporous Cu-MOF for laccase immobilization.[38] However, in all of these reports, MOF stability at pH 4-6 was a major issue. In this study, we aimed to prepare alternative MOFs with high laccase loadings that are acid-stable in a one-pot synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, we have fabricated amine-functionalized supports (NH2-MIL(53)-Al) with laccase immobilization using a one-pot method. The MOF synthesis and enzyme immobilization processes are shown in Scheme 1. The loading capacity and activity of immobilized laccase on these MOFs were compared with those of native laccase under different thermal and pH conditions. Immobilization on the MOF support was facile without modification and the immobilized laccase possessed high catalytic activity, stability, and reusability.\n",

    "### Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Anhydrous aluminum chloride powder (AlCl3, 99%) and 2-amino-terephthalic acid (NH2-BDC) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Sodium hydroxide pellets (NaOH) were purchased from Rankem. Laccase (EC 1.10.3.2, _p_-benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductase) from Trametes versicolor (powder, light brown, >=0.5 U mg-1) and 2,2'-azino-bits(3-ethylbenzothiazolinone-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS, >=98% by HPLC) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals, USA. For sodium acetate buffer preparation, sodium acetate tribylurate (CH3COONa-3H2O) was purchased from Rankem and glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Millipore water was used for all reactions.\n",

    "### Synthesis of NMOFs (NH2-MIL-53(Al))\n",
    "\n",
    "Nanoscale metal-organic framework NH2-MIL-53(Al) was prepared in water at room temperature using the procedure of M. Sanchez Sanchez _et al._[39] Solution 1 was prepared by dissolving NH2-BDC (75.12 mg, 0.253 mmol) and NaOH (28 mg, 0.7 mmol) in distilled water (4 mL) with magnetic stirring at 400 rpm. Solution 2 was prepared by dissolving AlCl3 (100 mg) in distilled water (4 mL). Solution 2 was added dropwise to solution 1 with stirring and a yellow solid formed immediately. After stirring for 12 h, the product was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. The synthesized NMOF was dried at 55 \"C in a vacuum oven and characterized.\n",

    "### One-pot synthesis of NMOF-immobilized laccase [NH2-MIL-53(Al)/laccase]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the one-pot immobilization of laccase into NMOFs, NH2-MIL-53(Al) was prepared using the procedure described above. Solutions 1 and 2 were prepared as above, with solution 2 added dropwise to solution 1 with stirring. After stirring for 1 h, a fixed amount of laccase (100 mg) in distilled water (6 mL) was added dropwise to the mixture and stirred for a further 12 h. The resultant yellow product was separated from the reaction mixture by centrifugation and washed three times with distilled water. Some of the product was stored at 4 degC to maintain laccase activity, while residual product NH2-ML53(Al)/laccase was dried at 55 degC in a vacuum oven for further characterization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Laccase activity assay\n",
    "\n",
    "The activities of free and immobilized laccase were determined using ABTS as substrate. First, ABTS solution (15 mM) was prepared by dissolving ABTS (82.305 mg) in distilled water (10 mL). The activities of free and immobilized laccase were determined using the assay described by Li _et al._40,41 Briefly, ABTS solution (0.1 mL) was added to sodium acetate buffer (2.9 mL, pH ~ 4.6) containing a certain amount of free and immobilized laccase. The mixture was stirred gently for 5 min and then absorbance was measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kinetic study (_K_m & _V_max)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinetics parameters for free and immobilized laccase were determined by varying the substrate concentrations from 0.5 mM to 1.0 mM in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6) at 25 degC. Kinetic parameters, such as the Michaelis-Menten constant (_K_m) and maximum rate of reaction (_V_max), were calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot:48,49\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\\frac{1}{V} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} + \\frac{K_{\\text{m}}}{V_{\\max}\\left[ \\text{S} \\right\\rbrack}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where [S] is the substrate ( ABTS) concentration and \\(V\\) is the reaction rate. The plot of \\(\\frac{1}{V}\\)_vs_, \\(\\frac{1}{\\left[ \\text{S} \\right\\rbrack}\\) was linear. _V_max was obtained from the intercept and _K_m was calculated from the slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effects of pH and temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of pH on free and immobilized laccase was assessed by measuring the enzyme activity in acetate buffer at different pH values (pH 3-7) at room temperature. Free and immobilized laccase were placed in each solution with different pH values for 30 min and enzymatic activities were determined using the activity assay described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of temperature on free and immobilized laccase in acetate buffer (pH ~ 4.6) was also assessed at different temperatures, ranging from 30 to 90 degC. Free and immobilized laccase were exposed to each temperature for 30 min and enzyme activity was determined using the activity assay described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability study\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermal stabilities of free and immobilized laccase were assessed in acetate buffer solution (pH ~ 4.6). Solutions of free and immobilized laccase were heated on a water bath at 60 degC and enzyme activity was determined at 30 min intervals for 3 h. The activities of both free and immobilized laccase were then compared with the initial solution, which was considered to have 100% activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stability of immobilized laccase was assessed during storage for seven weeks. Immobilized laccase was centrifuged from the reaction mixture, washed several times with distilled water, and then stored at 4 degC. The activity was examined at 7 day intervals in acetate buffer solution. Finally, the activities were compared with the initial activity (first day activity, considered 100% activity) using the activity assay.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reusability of the immobilized enzyme was assessed to determine its operational stability by recycling the same immobilized enzyme in acetate buffer solution at room temperature. After each use, the immobilized laccase was separated from the reaction mixture, washed with distilled water, and reused for activity determination. Finally, the activities were compared with the initial activity (considered 100% activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Study of loading capability\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the loading capability of enzymes into the NMOFs, different amounts of laccase were used in the one-pot synthesis. Firstly, solutions 1 and 2 were prepared by dissolving NH2-BDC (37.56 mg) with equivalent amounts of NaOH (14 mg) and AlCl3 (50 mg) in water, respectively. Solution 2 was then added to solution 1 with stirring. Different amounts of laccase (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg) in distilled water (4 mL) were added to each experiment. The activity of the product from each experiment was then determined from absorbance using the ABTS activity assay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characterization\n",
    "\n",
    "The morphologies of NMOF and laccase-immobilized NMOFs were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis using a Supra 55 instrument with an airlock chamber. The average hydrodynamic particle size was analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques (SZ-100 instrument, Horiba Scientific, Japan). Surface functional groups were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR; Thermo Nicolet Nexux FTIR (model 870)) at room temperature with a scanning range of 400-4000 cm-1 using the KBr pellet technique. The phase structure and crystal morphology were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an Expert Pro (Philips) X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kz radiation. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite was conducted using an SDTQ600 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA instruments) under N2 from 50 to 900 degC at a rate of 10 degC min-1. The surface area and pore size distribution of the NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite were determined using a microporous Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Instruments). Laccase activity was detected by UV-vis spectroscopy using a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrophotometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3 Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, we have developed a one-pot synthetic procedure for laccase immobilization into NMOFs. NH2-ML53(Al) NMOF was chosen as the support owing to its good stability at low pH, maximal laccase immobilization on the NMOF surface, and good storage stability after enzyme immobilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Surface morphology & particle size analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface morphology of NH2-ML53(Al) and the extent of one-pot laccase immobilization were determined using FESEM,as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c). Laccase immobilization into the NMOFs had no effect on the surface morphology. The NMOF particle size was about 30-40 nm and remained similar after increase immobilization. Furthermore, DLS analysis was conducted for the NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (d), respectively. The DLS study showed that the hydrodynamic diameter of the NMOF was 101 nm, while that of the NMOF-laccase composite was 134 nm. This increase might be due to enzymes being immobilized both on the outer NMOF surface and inside the NMOF framework. However, DLS showed one conflicting result, with the particle size of both the NMOF and NMOF-laccase composite larger than those observed by FESEM. This might be due to NMOF agglomeration and particle swelling in the water medium.42 DLS measurements show the average hydrodynamic particle diameter rather than the actual size, which might explain the increased particle size compared with those measured by FESEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the effect of laccase immobilization on the NMOF morphology, NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase was prepared using different amounts of laccase (20, 30, 40, and 50 mg). FESEM images of the resultant NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase composited are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI+). These FESEM images confirmed that there was no change in the surface morphology during laccase immobilization into the NMOF and that the particle size remained almost the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FTIR analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Laccase immobilization into NH2-ML-53(Al) in the one-pot procedure was examined by surface functional group analysis using FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR spectra of laccase, NMOF, and NMOF-laccase composite are shown in Fig. 2a. The NMOF peak at 3656 cm-1 was attributed to bridging -OH groups,43 while peaks at 3500 cm-1 and 3385 cm-1 were attributed to -NH2 groups.43,44 Peaks in the region 1200-1700 cm-1 were attributed to Al-coordinated carboxylate groups.44 Furthermore, bands at around 1700 and 1500 cm-1 were attributed to asymmetric stretching of carbonyl groups, while bands at around 1440 and 1400 cm-1 were assigned to symmetric stretching of carbonyl groups. For laccase, the band observed at 3680-3000 cm-1 was due to -OH and -NH bonds, while the peak at 2920 cm-1 was due to C-H stretching in CH2 groups present in laccase protein.45,46 Other characteristic protein peaks were also present in laccase.46-48 For example, the spectrum also showed an amide I band at 1642 cm-1 due to C=O stretching, an amide III band around 1420-1210 cm-1 due to CN stretching and NH bending, amide V and VI bands at 800-500 cm-1 due to out of plane NH and C=O bending, and a band at 1165-948 cm-1 characteristic of protein in laccase. The FTIR spectrum of NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase after one-pot immobilization showed that all characteristic peaks of lacase and the NMOF were present. Magnified images of the FTIR spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI+). A broad band observed at 3720-3000 cm-1 was due to overlap of the corresponding bands in laccase (for -OH and -NH bonds) and NH2-ML-53(Al) (for bridging -OH and NH2 groups). A slightly broad band was also observed at around 2920 cm-1 due to -CH2 groups in laccase. The NMOF peaks in the region 1700-1200 cm-1 were also present after lacase immobilization. However, some NMOF peaks were slightly broader in NH2-ML-53(Al)/laccase due to the presence of lacase. A slightly broadening\n",

All other increase peaks, such as protein peaks (1165-948 cm-1), were also present in NMOF-lactase composites. There, FTIR analysis showed that laccase was successfully immobilized into the NH2-MIL-53(Al) structure, with both the enzyme and NMOF remaining intact.\n",
