    "In an attempt to make the biocatalyst preparation economically viable, the peroxidase enzyme extracted from orange peel (Girrus sienes, a fruit waste) was immobilized within metal-organic framework (MOF) via self-assembled biomineralization method. The synthesis of OPP-MOF was accomplished by simply mixing 2-methylimidazole (24 mmol), zinc acetate (8 mmol) and orange peel extract at room temperature within 30 min. The obtained OPP-MOF was confirmed by using different characterization methods such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FI-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The half-life of OPP-MOF was determined in the temperature range of 40-60 degC which showed 2.1 folds enhanced thermal stability as compared to free enzyme. Further, Michaels constant (Ksd) and maximum rate (Vmax) values of OPP-MOF were evaluated by Michaels-Menten kinetics studies which showed higher Ksd and lower Vmax as compared to native peroxidase. Furthermore, peroxidase-MOF retained 48% residual activity after 6th cycle. Also, the storage stability studies of OPP-MOF revealed that there was no significant loss in its activity till 18 days. Finally, immobilized OPP-MOF was used for degradation of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR) dye, and it was found to be more efficient and rapid.\"\"\"\n",

    "Enzymes are green catalyst which have evolved from an academic curiosity to industrially attractive technology for driving bio-transformation processes. Also, they are widely used for various applications such as biosensors, bioremediation, wastewater treatment, food and pharmaceutical industries [1,2]. Though enzymes have certain inherent advantages, their applicability on industrial level is always a challenge due to difficulties in recovery and reusability for several cycles. The lack of enzyme stability at industrial operational conditions is also an obstacle in their employment in industry [3]. Another problem associated with the use of soluble enzymes (liquid form) is generation of waste in the reaction mixture. Additionally, it contaminates the product (due to presence of enzyme/protein) which ultimately increases the purification cost [4]. These challenges can be addressed by various enzyme immobilization methods which drastically enhance the enzyme properties such as its thermo-stability, tolerance to organic solvents, wide range of pH, selectivity and its employability in industrial/practical uses. The immobilization also eases the enzyme recovery and re-use, resulting in its cost-effective use focusing its industrial applications [5]. Combined downstream processing includes separation and purification in one step which could be the effective factor to decrease the cost of an enzyme usage on industrial scale. It can be achieved by two ways: (i) by limiting the number of purification steps or simultaneously purifying and (ii) immobilizing the samples. There are some reported strategies for enzyme purification and immobilization in minimum steps, which makes the entire biocatalyst preparation economically viable [6].\n",

    "Enzymes extraction from fruit wastes can be one of the effective ways of utilization of fruit wastes which are obtained in large quantities (number of moles) during the fruit processing. [15] In India, huge fruit wastes are generated annually which is about 5.6 million ton. These wastes are disposed by dumping on the outskirts [16,17]. Utilizing the waste for value added product formation take us one step further in making the process greener. The peroxidase enzyme from orange peel has been reported to possess wide substrates range, high stability for wide range of pH and temperature. These properties make it an attractive enzyme source for derivation and its valorisation [18]. Earlier, peroxidase immobilization has been reported on various supports such as agarose-chitosan hydrogel [19]. It has been further used for various applications such as environmental remediation (removal of hazardous pollutants, dyes), biomedical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and biotechnological industries [20]. Here, in this work, we have extracted peroxidase from orange peel and immobilized it within MOF, reducing the enzyme purification steps and making it viable for industrial applications. When crude enzyme is mixed with the counterpart of MOFs, enzyme (protein) molecules induce the formation of MOF around enzyme. This results in one step purification and immobilization of OPP into hybrid MOF, forming OPP-MOF composite. Such peroxidase-encapsulated MOF can be readily prepared _via_ a biomineralization procedure in aqueous solution under mild operational conditions. The characterization of OPP-MOF was done by XRD and FT-IR to identify crystalline nature and immobilization of OPP within ZIF-8. For the size, shape and morphology analysis, SEM was used. The Michaelis-Menten kinetics parameters were determined for OPP-MOF and the free form of peroxidase. Thermo-kinetic studies were carried out for free enzyme and OPP-MOF to determine the thermal stability in terms of thermal deactivation constant (k\\({}_{\\text{d}}\\)), half-life (t\\({}_{1/2}\\)) and deactivation energy (Ea). Finally, different dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and congo red (CR) were degraded by using OPP-MOF.\"\"\"\n",
